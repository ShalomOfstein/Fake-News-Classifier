 WATCH: Republican Analyst Who Worked For Nixon Says Trump Is In Impeachment Territory,"If anybody knows when a president is qualified for impeachment, it s David Gergen.After all, he worked in the Nixon Administration.Donald Trump s Russia scandal has gotten even bigger over the last week. Just a day after firing FBI Director James Comey, Trump met with Russian officials in the Oval Office and leaked highly classified information and compromised the source of that intelligence and our own national security.And now, there s a memo written by Comey noting that Trump asked him to drop the Russia investigation.Interestingly enough, it s the memo that could end up bringing Trump down.You see, asking the head of a federal agency to drop an investigation and then firing that person later on for refusing to do so is the very definition of obstruction of justice and impeding an investigation.As it turns out, obstruction of justice is what led to impeachment proceedings against former President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal.Republican analyst David Gergen delivered that explanation during a segment on CNN on Tuesday.When Anderson Cooper asked Gergen to weigh in, the longtime Republican said that Trump has entered  impeachment territory. I was in the Nixon Administration as you know and I thought after watching the Clinton impeachment, I thought I would never see another one,  Gergen began.  But I think we re in impeachment territory for the first time. The obstruction of justice was the number one charge against Nixon that brought him down. Obstruction of justice was the number one charge against Bill Clinton,  Gergen continued. It looks like he was trying to impede the investigation. He was using his power to do that, and when James Comey didn t go along with him, when he wasn t his boy, he fired him This is of enormous consequence for his presidency. Gergen then concluded that all the bombshells dropped over the last week, including Comey s firing, sharing classified intelligence with the Russians, and the revelation that Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation are causing Trump s presidency to unravel. What we see is a presidency that s starting to come apart,  Gergen said.Here s the video via YouTube.It is now clear that Trump fired Comey because he refused to drop the investigation. That is obstruction of justice and should result in Trump being impeached. Of course, Republicans in Congress have no interest in impeaching Trump. That would require having the courage and a soul.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"May 17, 2017"
 WATCH: New Documentary Explores Trump’s Russian Mob Links,"This past week the world has been hit with many newsworthy stories from the White House that all contain one common theme: Russia. From Trump sharing classified information with Russian government diplomats to the fallout of the FBI Director James Comey firing over the investigation of Russian election interference, all signs point to Trump having deeper Russian ties than he would like to admit.A Dutch documentary was released this month by Zembla production company called  The Dubious Friends of Donald Trump,  that explores the history and connections the president has in Russia and to explain the facts behind the swirling allegations.The filmmakers highlight Russian mafia oligarchs while investigating the President s business partners, as well as his history with the country that started with his first Russian visit back in the 1980s.The film contains interviews with some of Trump s shady friends, fraud investigators, a former CIA agent, attorneys, and U.S. Senators.The filmmakers interview former U.S. intelligence officer Malcolm Nance who speaks about the President s aversion to any critical assessments of Russia: If you re a gambling addict and you owe someone a lot of money, you will never insult your bookie,  Nance says.The focus of the documentary is on answering questions the world has about Trump s connection with Russia: Why does Trump deny his business connections with Russia and what do they say about him? How compromising could these connections be? Check out the film and make those judgments for yourself:Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"May 16, 2017"
 WATCH: Fox News’ Tucker Carlson SCREAMS About Dirty Bathrooms To Avoid Talking About Trump,"Fox News personalities and Trump surrogates seem to be desperate to do anything to take attention away from the fact that we ve got a treasonous bastard in the White House. Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and others, are doing absolutely everything they can to pretend that Trump is this strong, powerful, amazing and upstanding guy   the best president we ve ever had. And to do so, they ll say pretty much anything.Tonight, Tucker Carlson jumped on New York City councilman Corey Johnson over his bill to try and force Trump to release his tax returns. Carlson believes that Johnson has better things to do than try to help America figure out if our president has severe conflicts of interest that prevent him from acting in the country s best interest. One of those things Carlson says Johnson ought to pay attention to is the dirty bathrooms in Penn Station: By the way, ignore the guy living under the ATM machine, or relieving himself next to- I m serious! I go there every week, and that s your- Penn Station is yours! And you re worrying about Trump s tax returns? Are you joking? Have you been in the men s room there? Then it just devolves into a shouting match with Carlson frantically trying to derail the conversation so he doesn t have to listen to more about Trump. Watch below:Tucker Carlson screaming about Penn Station bathrooms to avoid talking about Trump s Russia ties. I know this sounds fake. It s not. Enjoy. pic.twitter.com/Nlj1SPHen7  Carlos Maza (@gaywonk) May 17, 2017Penn Station is in Johnson s district, true. And it s very sad, but train station toilets in major cities the world over are gross. I live in Chicago   they re pretty gross here, too. However, that s a massive deflection there because the fact of the matter is that it s long past time for Trump to level with us, or be forced to. Carlson is also acting like the only thing the New York City council is working on is trapping Trump   that s far from true. But they have other pressing matters and limited funding, just like many other major cities here in the U.S.Trump is proving himself to be a threat, and we need to know exactly how.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"May 16, 2017"
 Chaffetz Says Congress ‘Needs To See’ Comey Memos On Trump NOW: ‘I Have My Subpoena Pen Ready’,"The Trump administration is in a tailspin after fired FBI Director James Comey revealed that Donald Trump had pressured him to drop the investigation into his campaign s collusion with Russia   and he has the paper trail to prove it. Not surprisingly, even Republican lawmakers want to see Comey s memos. Now.GOP senator Jason Chaffetz told NBC on Tuesday that  if the memo exists, I need to see it and I need to see it right away. He added that he is already  drafting the necessary paperwork to get the memo.  When asked if he would consider issuing a subpoena to get the memos, Chaffetz said that if this memo exists, he will  use every tool we have to get it.The Republican senator then took to Twitter to erase any doubt about his seriousness regarding this matter, writing that he has his  subpoena pen ready. .@GOPoversight is going to get the Comey memo, if it exists. I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready.  Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) May 16, 2017Chaffetz, who is the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, followed up by sending a letter to Andrew McCabe, acting Director of the FBI, on Tuesday night. He requested that  all memoranda, notes, summaries, and recordings referring or relating to any communications between Comey and the President  be turned over to the committee by May 24.Shit is getting deep for Trump. Not a single Republican congressman or senator has been willing to publicly defend Trump since he was busted blabbing top-secret info to Russia and he is quickly losing what little support he had in Washington. At this point, I know not to hold my breath, but maybe, just maybe, Trump s time in the White House is finally coming to an end.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 16, 2017"
 Trump’s Leaks To Russia May Well Have Put Individual Lives In Serious Danger,"Trump s ignorance, incompetence, and ego are putting intelligence agents at risk.It won t come as any surprise that international espionage is a complicated, high-stakes affair. At any given time, agents from countries all around the world are embedded with ISIS and other terrorist groups, secretly reporting back to their superiors in order to ensure that America and her allies have the latest intelligence. As the New York Times and Addicting Info have reported, the intelligence that President Trump shared with the Russians came from Israeli sources. That s a problem.Iran is one of Israel s greatest enemies and one of Russia s biggest allies. They certainly have an interest in learning everything they can about Israeli intelligence assets. And now, thanks to Donald Trump s startling incompetence, their Russian allies are free to tell them everything they know.The Wall Street Journal s statement confirming Israeli intelligence was the source.This sort of intelligence breach is literally unprecedented. Until now, no American president has ever handled classified information so carelessly. But that s not the worst of it. Israeli field agents have been compromised thanks to Trump s propensity for gossip. Sources say that they re being recalled right now, forced to flee from the ISIS units in which they ve worked so hard to embed themselves.One of the biggest ironies about this ongoing story is just how many intelligence officials worried it was going to happen. Stories have broken since the election last year that quote intelligence sources saying they were worried about Trump s stupidity.It was NOT appropriate 4 Trump 2 disclose this intel to Russia. It was NOT ours to share. It was Israel's, provided on high confidentiality.  Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) May 16, 2017One article, which ran in Israeli newspaper Haaretz and was written by investigative reporter Ronen Bergman, mentions this exact scenario, complete with a warning from American intelligence agents not to trust Trump. The article said,  American intelligence officials implied that Israel should  be careful  when transferring intelligence information to the White House and the National Security Council following Trump s inauguration   at least until it is clear that Trump does not have inappropriate connections with Russia. Nobody can say we weren t warned.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images",News,"May 16, 2017"
 Dave Chappelle: ‘I F***ed Up’ When Asking To Give Trump A Chance (DETAILS),"Comedian Dave Chappelle, known for his razor-sharp and hilarious views on race in America, is officially apologizing for asking America to give Trump a chance.Chappelle asked people to give Trump some time to settle into his role as President before judging him last year, during a monologue on Saturday Night Live that aired a few days after the election. But in a set the comedian performed at Caroline s in New York, he told the audience that he regrets what he said.Chappelle got right to the point with his apology, saying  I was the first guy on TV to say  Give Trump a chance.  I fucked up. Sorry.  That time when Dave Chappelle apologized for asking us to give Trump a chance  The self-proclaimed ""Jane Goodall"" of white people now has this to say about Trump's instability, the Muslim ban, and what a black presidency was expected to look like ??? #davechappelle #nyc @robinhoodnycA post shared by Caroline NYC (@caroline_newyork) on May 15, 2017 at 11:26pm PDTHe went on to deliver a strong set that touched on exactly why he was wrong. Chappelle said,  Every day you wake up and you never know what [Trump] is going to do next. The comedian also touched on Trump s racism and Islamophobia, bringing up the President s failed Muslim ban,  Donald Trump said we shouldn t let any Muslims into the United States  until we can figure out what s going on.  And I think that s way out of step with the way people feel in America. At the time, his SNL monologue got some pushback from media critics who argued that giving Trump a chance to be Presidential, after spending most of his campaign behaving badly, was misguided.Chappelle couched his call for tolerance with a plea for Trump to return the favor, saying at the time,  I m wishing Donald Trump luck. And I m going to give him a chance, and we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one too. But clearly Chappelle doesn t feel like Trump has held up his end of the bargain, and it s hard to disagree with that sentiment.",News,"May 16, 2017"
" FBI MEMO CONFIRMS: Trump Told Comey To End Russia Probe, Attack Press In The Most ABHORRENT Way","Trump has been bested by a man who is far smarter and far more ethical than he could ever dream of. James Comey apparently documented his conversations with Trump in memos, and the New York Times has spoken to at least two people who reportedly have those memos and read parts of it to them. In one memo, which documents a conversation that happened back in February, Comey reports that Trump said: I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. This conversation reportedly took place the day after Flynn resigned, so we can assume that Trump thought, or hoped, that he could force that to be the end of it. The White House has already made it clear that they re going to try and pin this whole mess on Flynn and claim ignorance, and a conversation like this, with Trump asking Comey to drop it, fits in with that narrative rather well.But that s not all. That memo also reportedly says that Trump told Comey to consider jailing members of the press who publish classified leaks. Trump believes that the leaks coming from the White House are the bigger threat and has been raging for weeks that the FBI hasn t been focusing on those.In other words, Trump was not only trying to turn all eyes off of him, he wanted Comey to start working on his  jail all press who speak negatively of me  plan.Comey was known for taking detailed notes, particularly when he felt that the details of a conversation might be questioned later on. The Times reports that he created memos about every meeting and phone call he and Trump, and he did share some of them with senior FBI officials.Of course, the White House is fervently denying this conversation happened this way. According to the Times piece, their official statement on the matter says: While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn. The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey. Of course it s not, at least, not to the White House. Trump has said that this investigation is a hoax perpetrated by the Democrats in his desperation to appear totally innocent. He even had a law firm send a certified letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham that was somehow supposed to prove that neither he, nor his associates, colluded with Russia at any time.Trump never succeeded in getting Comey to do what he wanted in anything. He never got Comey to shift his attention to leaks of classified info and jailing members of the press who published them, and he never got Comey to stop investigating his own, and his campaign s, ties to Russia. He s now so desperate that he s sending out fundraising emails begging his supporters to help him win against the  deep state. No wonder Comey was fired. Expect the White House to spin up a brand-new web of lies, which may include more threats against Comey and other FBI officials.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"May 16, 2017"
 Trump Sends Out Email Begging Supporters To Send Him Money To Defend Against His Scandals,"Minutes after news broke that Donald Trump had asked James Comey to drop his investigation into Michael Flynn   and that Comey had kept documentation of that meeting unbeknownst to Trump   Trump s never-ending campaign arm shot out an email asking his supporters to send him money. The grifting never stops.In the email, DonaldJTrump.com tells Trump s followers that there is a vast conspiracy against him by people who don t want him to  drain the swamp.  According to the tortured logic, these secret  special interest  groups conspired to destroy him by leaking the criminal and boneheaded things that he has been doing. And naturally, the  media  was also involved:You already knew the media was out to get us.But sadly it s not just the fake news  There are people within our own unelected bureaucracy that want to sabotage President Trump and our entire America First movement.Steve Bannon was right when he said,  If you think they re going to give you your country back without a fight, you re sadly mistaken. Every day is going to be a fight. That is the promise of Donald Trump.

Just out from Trump campaign subject lined ""SABOTAGE"" pic.twitter.com/w7xy0L47oF  Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) May 16, 2017Trump s team promises that the next step is to  completely DRAIN THE SWAMP.  It s unclear how Trump plans to do that when his Secretary of State is an oil executive, half his staff comes from Goldman Sachs, and his own daughter has an office down the hall from the Oval Office.The wording in the email suggests that Trump and his band of followers are retreating even further into their own paranoid delusions. The leaks Trump is so concerned about have been independently confirmed time and again. Trump himself, in his own blustering way, often confirms reports about himself in fits of rage. In the most recent example, Trump took to Twitter to loudly acknowledge that he had given sensitive information to Russia despite his own staff saying it was  false  the night before.Left with few options, Trump is now declaring all out war on the truth. Any bad press is  fake news  and  deep state  malcontents trying to undermine him. The much more realistic idea that Trump himself is so completely incompetent that he brings these scandals on himself never occurs to him.Featured image by Michael Reynolds-Pool via Getty Images",News,"May 16, 2017"
" BREAKING: Israel’s “Worst Fears Confirmed,” Says Israeli Intelligence Official In Wake Of Trump Revelation","In a bombshell revelation, The New York Times named Israel the source of the classified information that Trump leaked to the Russian government last week.Today, an Israeli intelligence officer disclosed to BuzzFeed that Israel is very concerned about Trump actions   despite the fact that the Israeli government said they wouldn t change their intelligence relationship with the White House. We have an arrangement with America which is unique to the world of intelligence sharing,  the official explained.  We do not have this relationship with any other country There is a special understanding of security cooperation between our countries. To know that this intelligence is shared with others, without our prior knowledge? That is, for us, our worst fears confirmed. Earlier this year the same unnamed Israeli official told BuzzFeed that Israeli Intelligence had major concerns over Trump and what he might disclose to Russia   a very close ally to Israel s top adversary, Iran.The President has a visit scheduled in Israel for next week as part of a large global tour that includes Saudi Arabia and the Vatican. This might not be the best time for Trump to travel to Isreal, seeing as he may have just outed them to their biggest enemy.

 REVEALED: Trump’s Senior Advisers Afraid To Leave Him Alone In Meetings With Foreign Leaders,"Conservatives thought an unpredictable president would be a good idea, but as it turns out, to be the leader of the free world, you have to measure your words, think before you talk, and above all, don t reveal highly classified data. Monday night, after it was discovered that amateur president Donald Trump bragged to Russian officials, then revealed intelligence information to them, his White House staffers were heard screaming in a nearby office. It was like a White House slap fight was taking place with no one able to contain the damage.It gets worse.Trump s national security and foreign policy staffs have been spending much of their time planning for his upcoming eight-day trip to the Middle East and Europe. The former reality show star is meeting with foreign leaders after his major blunder with sensitive information.The New York Times reports:There is a growing sense that Mr. Trump seems unwilling or unable to do the things necessary to keep himself out of trouble, and that the presidency has done little to tame a shoot-from-the-hip-into-his-own-foot style that characterized his campaign.There is a fear among some of Mr. Trump s senior advisers about leaving him alone in meetings with foreign leaders out of concern he might speak out of turn. General McMaster, in particular, has tried to insert caveats or gentle corrections into conversations when he believes the president is straying off topic or onto boggy diplomatic ground.(my emphasis)According to two officials, McMaster s gentle corrections has irked Trump. And remember, Trump has publicly declared that his former security adviser, Michael Flynn, was a  wonderful man.  Trump said that after Flynn was forced to resign.Trump has said that General McMaster talks too much in meetings, and the former reality show star has referred to him as  a pain,  according to one of the officials.In private, three administration officials conceded that they could not publicly articulate their most compelling   and honest   defense of the president: that Mr. Trump, a hasty and indifferent reader of printed briefing materials, simply did not possess the interest or knowledge of the granular details of intelligence gathering to leak specific sources and methods of intelligence gathering that would do harm to United States allies.In December, Trump said,  I don t need daily intelligence briefings.  Tuesday morning, Trump admitted on Twitter that he revealed the intel to the Russian officials. A few hours later, McMaster held a press briefing to do damage control. He bizarrely explained that since Trump didn t know where the Intel came from, it was  wholly inappropriate  for him to disclose it.It suddenly makes sense why White House press secretary Sean Spicer was recently seen hiding in the bushes.Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images.",News,"May 16, 2017"
 Erik Erikson: Trump’s Russia Leak ‘Is Actually Far Worse Than What is Being Reported’ (DETAILS),"Conservative pundit Erik Erikson is weighing in on Donald Trump s decision to blab highly classified information to the Russians during a closed-door meeting at the White House and he is vouching for at least one of the sources.In a blog post on his website, The Resurgent, Erikson said that usually, he takes  these stories about the President with a grain of salt.  But this time, things are different because he knows that the information is coming from a credible source whom he knows personally. He notes that the source is actually very pro-Trump,  or at least has been and was during Campaign 2016. Erikson explains that since Trump refuses to accept any advice or criticism, members of his administration  are left with no other option but to go to the media, leak the story, and hope that the intense blowback gives the President a swift kick in the butt. Perhaps then he will recognize he screwed up. I am told that what the President did is actually far worse than what is being reported. The President does not seem to realize or appreciate that his bragging can undermine relationships with our allies and with human intelligence sources. He also does not seem to appreciate that his loose lips can get valuable assets in the field killed,  Erikson writes. You can call these sources disloyal, traitors, or whatever you want,  he continues.  But please ask yourself a question   if the President, through inexperience and ignorance, is jeopardizing our national security and will not take advice or corrective action, what other means are available to get the President to listen and recognize the error of his ways? Erikson concludes by affirming his absolute belief that the information about Trump sharing top secret info with Russia is credible.  This is a real problem and I treat this story very seriously because I know just how credible, competent, and serious   as well as seriously pro-Trump, at least one of the sources is.

" White House DEFENDS Trump By Admitting He’s An IDIOT, Claims He “Wasn’t Aware” Of Intel Source Or Methods (VIDEO)","After the bombshell news that Trump gave highly classified information to Russian, the White House is scrambling to defend his conduct, no matter how reckless. National security adviser H.R. McMaster argued to the press on Tuesday that the President didn t jeopardize U.S. intelligence by giving out highly sensitive intel to Russian Officials, and added that Trump had no idea where the intel came from.McMaster stated  The President in no way undermined sourced or methods in the course of this conversation,  saying that anyone could get their hands on this information in  open-source reporting. The real kicker is that McMaster argued that it was impossible for Trump to have endangered national security due to the fact that he did not even know what he was discussing.  The President wasn t even aware of where this information came from,  he said.  He wasn t briefed on the source. There was no denying that Trump discussed top secret information to Moscow s U.S. ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov. But McMaster attacked those who leaked the contents of the conversation to the media, insisting that is the story that people should be paying attention to. I think the real issue and what I would like to see debated more is that our national security has been put at risk by those violating confidentiality,  he said,  I think national security is put at risk by this leak and leaks like this. McMaster noted that the administration would be investigating the source of leaks to reporters, but did not respond to the question of who would be conducting the investigation.Reports on Monday from the Washington Post said the discussion was about Islamic State information, which came from a U.S. ally with the stipulation that it would not be shared with other governments.Officials from the Democratic and Republican party are both outraged by this revelation and its potential to put intelligence sources and partners at risk.See McMaster s full statement here:Feature image via video screengrab",News,"May 16, 2017"
 ‘Pay Bribes Here’ Projected On Trump Hotel,"Last night, Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC played host to a temporary art installation. The words  pay Trump bribes here  and  emoluments welcome  were projected on the front entrance of the building. The project instantly captured the attention of Twitter and went viral even as it was happening. This morning, we learned that the projection was another project of DC-based artist Robin Bell. Bell, who works as a video journalist and multimedia artist for his own Bell Visuals, has put together projects like this before. In November of last year, Bell put together a similar campaign to oppose the climate change-denier that Trump put in charge of his EPA transition team. He has also put together other projects in support of cannabis legalization and in support of women s reproductive rights.In an interview with the Los Angeles Time, Bell said that he s not worried about getting in trouble for his art installations. These fringe alt-right groups have gone from a minority of hateful assholes to having the ear of the president, which is terrifying,  Bell says.  The work that we do is a resistance to that. He said,  When we first started doing it, we were concerned and we reached out for legal advice. But from the research we did, it was legal. The one thing we can t do is block traffic. We can t create an impediment on the sidewalk. According to Bell, his largest goal is to get people talking about the issues. But he also sees his art as a way to fight against an authoritarian government.  I was reading this thing about when you deal with authoritarian governments, you have to create your own story,  he says.  If we re reacting to these people all the time, they can just play us. So, part of the thing is making things that you can laugh at, that you can share, that aren t just reacting to them. Photography and video copyright Liz Gorman and Robin Bell",News,"May 16, 2017"
" Fox News Host Leaks That Spicer Is Getting Fired, Claims She’s Already In Talks To Take Over His Job","Already demonstrating her inability to keep her mouth shut, Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle seemingly leaked the fact that Trump has made up his mind to fire Sean Spicer as press secretary. She told Mercury News that Trump s staff have already contacted her and she s in talks to take over once the deed is done.This is news to  everybody  because the Trump White House has so far refused to confirm rumors that Spicer is on his way out. Guilfoyle seems pretty convinced. She spoke with the self-assured tone of a person who has already committed to the job in her head. I m a patriot, and it would be an honor to serve the country,  Guilfoyle said.  I think it d be a fascinating job, it s a challenging job, and you need someone really determined and focused, a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position. Leaving nothing to chance, she also took pains to bash Sean Spicer with some ruthless concern trolling. If you want to be successful and do communications with President Trump, you have to be someone who he actually wants to spend a little bit of time with,  she said on the air.  You ve got to insist on getting in front of POTUS, talk to him, and have like five, six minutes with him before you go out there and take the podium, and otherwise you re driving blind. It has to be somebody with a very close relationship, where there s trust there, there s inherent loyalty, someone who s been there from the beginning,  she added. Loyalty  has become a major sticking point for Trump, whose paranoia and sense of alienation has left him with very few friends even among the White House.Adding more fuel to the fire, Guilfoyle (mockingly?) wished Sean Spicer  the best  going forward.Spicer was noticeably absent from Tuesday s press briefing. The last time reporters saw him, he was engaged in a screaming match with Steve Bannon and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.WH comms staffers just put the TVs on super loud after we could hear yelling coming from room w/ Bannon, Spicer, Sanders  Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) May 15, 2017Despite having nothing to do with either decision, Trump reportedly blames Spicer for both the James Comey and Russia classified intel leaks.

As the New York Times  Maggie Habermann points out, one way to lose an opportunity is to confirm it s happening. Trump, who hates anyone stealing his limelight, has previously torpedoed done-deals after they were leaked to the press out of sheer spite.This is quickest way to end a negotiation with Trumpland, to talk about it https://t.co/lLEYoNw0A2  Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) May 16, 2017It s likely Guilfoyle decided to risk a high-stakes gamble. The best way to make your case to Trump is through the media and with massive doses of flattery. The risk is getting too much attention and angering Trump. Her bet was that Trump would like the nice things she said about him more than he hated that she undermined his decision. (If all of this seems a bit  high school drama,  that s because it is.)Now it is left to be seen whether her gamble will pay off.Featured image via Allison Shelley/Getty Images",News,"May 16, 2017"
 Keith Olbermann Lashes Out At Trump For Whining About Leaks With One Perfect Tweet,"Keith Olbermann just fired an angry tweet at Donald Trump that will almost certainly leave him seething in fury.Last week, Trump gave highly classified intelligence to Russian officials during a meeting in the Oval Office in which Russian state media was allowed but American journalists were banned.Spilling the intel puts the source of the information in jeopardy and hurts our national security.The Russians can even use the information in order to silence the source from revealing their own activity in Syria. In short, American intelligence gathering efforts against ISIS and Russia have just been seriously compromised.Outrage immediately ensued after the story broke, with both Democrats and Republicans expressing concern over Trump s actions. The optic are also terrible in light of the fact that Trump is embroiled in a growing scandal involving Russia and had fired FBI Director James Comey the day before the meeting.Of course, Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to defend his actions, ending his rant by whining about leakers despite the fact that he leaked highly classified information to the Russians.As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining .

But while Clinton s emails were never hacked or read by anyone but her, Trump is going around bragging about highly classified intelligence and sharing it with the Russians.As we learned on Monday, Trump literally leaked the intel during an Oval Office meeting with Russian officials last week, the same meeting that American journalists were barred from covering while Russia state media was given free access.In short, Trump is a hypocrite who put the security of our nation in jeopardy because he is incapable of keeping his mouth shut.So it was not a surprise that Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman, exploded in anger on Tuesday morning over what should be considered yet another Russia scandal.The Morning Joe host delivered a scathing statement denouncing Trump and called upon the current Republicans in Congress to hold him accountable instead of cowardly ignoring a major breach of protocol. It s not enough for Mitch McConnell and conservative talk show hosts to simply attack the  lamestream  media or Nancy Pelosi,  Scarborough said.  Americans will not buy that. That s a cowardly act, and it s intended to hold onto as much of the audience that they can hold onto without embracing Trump. At this point, if you do not call him out for risking American lives and doing things that most intel people I spoke with last night said will lead to the death of Americans in the future or lead to the death of critical allies in this counterinsurgency battle against ISIS, then you are doing a grave disservice to your voters or to your listeners or to the United States of America. There is no middle ground here anymore   there just isn t. This is about national security in the United States of America. Indeed, Trump s blabbing put an asset at risk, one who is familiar with the inner workings of ISIS, a terrorist organization that wants to kill Americans.According to the Washington Post,Trump s disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State.The information the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government, officials said.The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trump s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State.As a candidate, Trump claimed that he would protect this country from ISIS, but by handing out classified information like it s candy, he just put our nation at serious risk and violated the trust of an asset, who is also now in serious jeopardy, which means our ability to get good intel on ISIS is compromised.In the end, Scarborough noted that Donald Trump just keeps getting worse. Here s the problem, the arc of this narrative keeps getting worse. People on the inside say he keeps getting worse, mentally keeps getting worse. This is not, unfortunately, a learning curve   this is a man in decline. Here s the video via VidMe.It s time for Republicans to admit that they screwed up by supporting Donald Trump. It s time for them to oust this administration and schedule a new election so that the American people can put someone in the White House who is competent and not Putin s puppet. This farce has gone on long enough and American lives are more in danger the longer Trump remains in office.Featured image via screenshot ",News,"May 16, 2017"

 NATO Officials Planning For Trump Visit As If He Is A Small Child (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is a small child in a 70-year-old man s body who somehow managed to get elected president of the United States. It seems that world leaders are aware of this, and therefore are now devising methods to deal with him as such. Case in point   Trump s very first summit with the other member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).NATO officials are well aware that Trump has the attention span of a toddler who needs a nap, so they are going to keep the topics simple and make sure that any remarks are limited to two to four minute bursts. In addition to the shortened speeches and elementary subject matter, the summit will have no formal statement after the meeting with the heads of state for the 28 countries in the NATO alliance. Officials in the know say that the people involved in setting all of this up to accommodate Trump s childlike ways are really scrambling, as the summit is set to commence on May 25. In short- they are going to Trump- proof the event. From Uproxx: It s kind of ridiculous how they are preparing to deal with Trump,  said one source briefed extensively on the meeting s preparations.  It s like they re preparing to deal with a child   someone with a short attention span and mood who has no knowledge of NATO, no interest in in-depth policy issues, nothing,  said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  They re freaking out. People are scared of his unpredictability, intimidated by how he might react knowing the president might speak his mind   or tweet his mind,  [a] former official said. Or, as another current senior NATO official put it before the meeting:  We re bracing for impact. As if this isn t bad enough, a big topic of this particular meeting of the NATO alliance will be how to share the costs and other burdens associated with NATO. Of course, we all remember how Trump actually gave German Chancellor Angela Merkel a bill for supposed monies she owes to NATO on her very first visit to our country. So, there s no telling what he ll say to other member nations on this topic at the summit. This worry has not escaped the international officials preparing for this event. Again, from Uproxx: His views of burden-sharing seem to be more ambitious than past presidents,  and that could become a source of tension at the big NATO confab, said Alexander Vershbow, former deputy secretary-general of NATO.  The burden-sharing conversation may not go entirely smoothly. This is beyond embarrassing. With each passing day, Trump s childish temperament, incompetence, and buffoonery lessens America s standing in the world. When will the Republicans in Congress wake up, admit they made a mistake by getting this man elected, and start preparing to oust him from office?Only time will tell. Until then, #RESIST.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 15, 2017"
 Trump Shocked As New Poll Reveals The Future Of Trumpcare; It’s Worse Than You Thought (Details),"It seems only natural that Donald Trump, the lowest rated president in modern history, should have extremely unpopular policies to match how much Americans refuse to support him.Aside from his disgustingly racist travel ban, there s another policy that Americans overwhelmingly despise   the American Health Care Act, also known as Trumpcare. While it s been widely known that Americans prefer Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) much more than Trump s shady, disastrous alternative, the real numbers prove to be worse than originally thought. It turns out, one poll states that over 75% of Americans don t want Trump s heath care plan to get anywhere near them and their loved ones.This recent poll cited that the American public s support for Trumpcare is only 23%, which basically means that Trump is screwed if he thinks he can get this health care bill to take the place of Obamacare. Almost half (48%) of Americans stated that they were against Trumpcare, with most (43%) responding that they were  strongly  opposed to it.So while Trump likes to brag about all this  winning  he s doing, we have yet to see it reflect in the American public s opinion of him and his policies. People are passionately resisting Trumpcare, and have even taken to GOP town halls to openly protest against and condemn GOP lawmakers who are trying to help Trump take out Obamacare.Trump may not want to admit it, but he s dying in the polls. It s also been reported that only 29% of Americans felt Trump was right to fire FBI Director James Comey, and 78% of the public wanted the Russia investigation to be handed off to an independent commission.The more Trump tries, the more he fails. As time goes on, we can only expect his approval rating to continue on its downward slope as he makes more horrible decisions for the country.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 15, 2017"
" Trump’s EPA OKs Pesticide That Causes Brain Damage In Children, Now Farmworkers Are Getting Sick","Farmworkers were pulled from fields on Friday after they came into contact with a chemical that the EPA recently approved. The chemical had originally been flagged by the Obama administration and was in the process of being banned when Trump s White House took over and gave it the greenlight.According to KTEG, more than 50 people working at the farm were exposed to the pesticide, causing the Dan Andrews farm to completely shut down. We started getting an odor, pesticide odor, coming in from the mandarin orchards west of our fields,  said farm supervisor Efron Zavalza.A pesticide called Vulcan, containing a poison called chlorpyrifos, has been sprayed the night before the workers come to the fields to work. I m not pointing fingers or saying it was done incorrectly. It was just an unfortunate thing the way it was drifted. The wind came and pushed everything east and you know we were caught in the path,  he observed.Twelve people suffered symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and fainting   though half the workers left before medical services could treat them.Mother Jones reported that the Obama administration had taken steps to permanently ban chlorpyrifos, but the new head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, reversed the regulation. By reversing the previous Administration s steps to ban one of the most widely used pesticides in the world, we are returning to using sound science in decision-making   rather than predetermined results,  stated the EPA.Health experts agree that when children are exposed to chlorpyrifos they tcan suffer brain damage and a lower IQ.  A report by the National Institutes of Health concludes that the chemical can cause  adverse developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effect. The decision to reverse regulations on this chemical is very scary and could cause a lot of people to get sick.Featured image via David McNew/Getty Images",News,"May 15, 2017"
" Reporters In Press Room Can Hear Screaming From Trump Staff Offices Nearby, Livetweet Meltdown","In a hilarious development to the disturbing news that Donald Trump leaked classified information to the Russians, reporters gathered in the White House press room to report that they are hearing screaming coming from deeper in the West Wing. Staffers must have heard the sounds too, because they quickly began cranking up the volume on the television sets placed around the room to help drown out the noise.Adrian Carrasquillo, a reporter for Buzzfeed, captured the meltdown in real time:Per @TreyYingst, Bannon, Mike Dubke, Sarah Sanders and Spicer walked into cabinet room just now. They did not look happy.  Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) May 15, 2017Can now hear yelling coming from room where officials are. https://t.co/xh8LQ0paPM  Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) May 15, 2017WH comms staffers just put the TVs on super loud after we could hear yelling coming from room w/ Bannon, Spicer, Sanders  Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) May 15, 2017Members of Trump s administration screaming at the top of their lungs is a good way to describe the mood within the White House. News of Trump s intelligence implosion came at an already dark time. Still reeling from Trump s firing of James Comey for refusing to stop the investigation into his involvement with Russia, and just hours after the news that Trump was hovering around the least popular he s ever been in the polls, the classified leaks from Donald Trump himself may have pushed several members of his team past their breaking points.The Daily Beast spoke to some of the despondent Trump staffers: Do not ask me about how this looks, we all know how this looks,  the senior aide told The Daily Beast on Monday evening. Trump administration officials spoke to The Daily Beast on the condition of anonymity so as to speak freely. The aide described a scene at the White House as tense and  a morgue. For months, Trump has demanded that his team find anyone who is leaking news of his dysfunctional White House to the press. The anger and fury did nothing. The Washington Post and Buzzfeed each have different sources confirming the fact that Trump handed classified information over to Russian diplomats in a hamfisted attempt to  brag  about his intel. The New York Times is also reporting that the source of the intel warned U.S. forces that if the information should leak, they would cut off communications.The classified info Trump shared with Russia came from an ally who already warned they'd cut off info if it leaked. https://t.co/5NPrIvPWWz pic.twitter.com/htpMfIfEwi  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) May 16, 2017Thanks Trump!In an amazing addition, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who has shown an ability to lie that tops even that of Sean Spicer, walked out of the room where shouts could clearly be heard and claimed that she didn t know anything about it.Sarah H. Sanders told reporters she didn't know anything about yelling. https://t.co/1CNSSomWKY  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) May 15, 2017She also said there would be no more press information tonight Sarah H. Sanders just addressed reporters in Upper Press advising there would be no further statements tonight.  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) May 15, 2017  which is understandable because how on earth do you, as Trump s team, possibly spin this as anything other than an impeachable offense?Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have taken an all-too predictable stance of loudly sighing, shaking their heads, and giving an exaggerated shrug.Featured image by Molly Riley-Pool via Getty Images",News,"May 15, 2017"
 Trump Gave HIGHLY Classified Information To Russian Ambassador Right After Firing Comey,"Whoa. The day after he fired now-former FBI Director James Comey, Donald Trump did perhaps the dumbest thing a person under investigation for collusion with Russia could possibly do: he gave highly classified information directly to representatives of the Russian government. How classified? It s stuff we haven t even shown our allies.The Washington Post reports that when Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Trump  went off script and began describing details about an Islamic State terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft. I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,  Trump bragged to the Russians according to a White House official:Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the United States only learned through the espionage capabilities of a key partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence gathering method, but described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State s territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.The Washington Post is withholding most plot details, including the name of the city, at the urging of officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardize important intelligence capabilities. Everyone knows this stream is very sensitive and the idea of sharing it at this level of granularity with the Russians is troubling,  a former senior U.S. counter-terrorism official who worked with Team Trump told the Post. Russia, armed with the information Trump handed them, can now use it to identify the U.S. ally or gain more information about intelligence operations. This is code-word information,  the official said.  Trump revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.  One official tells Buzzfeed that   it s far worse than what has already been reported. Russia could identify our sources or techniques,  the senior U.S. official explained. I don t think that it would be that hard [for Russian spy services] to figure this out. If that partner learned we d given this to Russia without their knowledge or asking first that is a blow to that relationship,  the official said, adding that Trump also informed the Kremlin about defensive measures the United States has taken. I m sure Kislyak was able to fire off a good cable back to the Kremlin with all the details. The meeting, which occurred just after The Donald fired James Comey for requesting additional resources for the Russia investigation, was off-limits to U.S. press, but Trump allowed Russian media in to take photographs. The White House readout does not discuss Trump s decision to give away our nation s secrets to the country that financed and executed a hacking a propaganda operation intended to install him in the Oval Office.Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 15, 2017"
" Second Congressman Calls For Trump’s Impeachment, Demands He ‘Be Charged’ (DETAILS)","Talk of impeachment has been commonplace in Congress since before Donald Trump was even sworn in. But following his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, who just happened to be in charge of investigating his shady Russian escapades, a second congressman is now explicitly calling for Trump to be impeached.Texas Democrat Al Green issued a statement on Monday demanding that Trump be charged and impeached.President Trump is not above the law. He has committed an impeachable act and must be charged. To do otherwise would cause him Americans lose respect for, and obedience to, our societal norms.President Trump has committed an act for which he should be charged by the U.S. House of Representatives. The act is the obstruction of a lawful investigation of the president campaign ties to Russian influence in his 2016 Presidential Election.This charging, of the president, then constitutionally as impeachment.Green goes on to explain that by impeaching Trump, the House would only be charging him for his crimes, not finding him guilty. After being impeached by the House, the Senate wound then hold a trial to determine his guilt.The congressman goes on to explain, that the House has no choice but to impeach Trump after he fired Comey, admitted he considered the Russia investigation when deciding whether to relieve the FBI director of his duties and then proceeded to threaten Comey publicly via Twitter.These acts, when combined, amount to intimidation and obstruction.Green called for Trump s impeachment by the House of Representatives one more time, then closed his statement with this sentiment:  Our mantra should be  I.T.N.   Impeach Trump Now.' Although many Democrats have discussed the possibility that Trump s presidency might end in impeachment, Green is only the second congressman to explicitly call for his impeachment.

 Ivanka Trump’s Hypocritical Mother’s Day Message Got DEMOLISHED By Women,"Ivanka Trump really should stop talking about these issues if she is going to continue to be complicit in her daddy s administration.Despite the fact that her dad s policies hurt women and children, Ivanka posted a Mother s Day message on Twitter focusing on pay inequality.Today, on Mother s Day, we must confront that motherhood is now a greater determinant of pay inequality than gender. https://t.co/n1HhF8PyVc  Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) May 15, 2017Pay inequality is a major problem in this country. Women currently make around 77 cents for every dollar a man makes for the same job and amount of work. At the same time, women also have to deal with the fact that maternity leave is often not a benefit offered by employers, nor is childcare. So it becomes even harder for women to make enough money to take care of their families.But while Ivanka may really care abut these issues, the problem is that she has mostly been a bystander whenever her dad signs legislation or an executive order that hurts women.For example, the Trumpcare bill would take healthcare away from millions of women. Just being a woman would be considered a pre-existing condition. So would sexual assault and pregnancy. Not only would a lot of moms suffer under this bill, their children would suffer as well.That s why Ivanka has been repeatedly accused of being complicit.She s a complete hypocrite who pretends to a be a feminist icon but she s not.

 Internet SLAMS Trump Over Mother’s Day Women’s Health HYPOCRISY (Tweets),"This morning our commander-in-chief wished Happy Mother s day to  all of the great mothers out there,  but women and men from all over America ripped him a new one as they responded to what most considered a hollow message from the president, who has proved to us through his words and actions that he isn t siding with women s health and well-being.With the Trumpcare plan being the GOP s main focus in the House and Senate, Trump is proving to be more of an enemy than a supporter of women. If this plan goes into effect, it would decimate health care access for women. The president and his Republican friends were on the receiving end of backlash today for what some see as ignorance, callous indifference, hypocrisy, and ignorance in the face of a health crisis for women. Want to support women & mothers? Give them access to they need to lead the lives they want. #TrumpCare doesn t care.

Its benefits will go, first and formost, to billionaires who make more money from investments than form work. the 400 highest-earing households in the county will get an average tac break of $7 million per year under the Republican Plan. The legislative group working towards the plan is comprised of thirteen men and not one single woman. The negative impacts of this plan on mothers and all females will be severe. Even coverage for prescription drugs, which women also utilize more than men, could lose its designation as an essential health benefit under the House bill.On the bright side, mother-daughter relationships with potentially divergent political views can come together around this topic.Best Mothers Day ever: after explaining to my conservative mom how #trumpcare would harm me, she asked how she could write her Senators  ??  tannerglass (@tannerglass) May 14, 2017Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 15, 2017"
 Ann Coulter Is Super Pissed That Trump Is A Disaster,"Donald Trump s number one fan still believes in him but her support is beginning to waver.Ann Coulter really thought Trump was the right candidate to take over the presidency. After all, he said mean things about Muslims and Mexicans and threatened to blow up the entire government. But despite the fact that Trump has already caused significant damage and issued executive orders targeting Muslims and Latinos, Coulter is apparently moving closer toward saying that Trump s opponents were right. I m not very happy with what has happened so far,  Coulter told the Daily Caller.  I guess we have to try to push him to keep his promises. But this isn t North Korea, and if he doesn t keep his promises I m out. This is why we voted for him. I think everyone who voted for him knew his personality was grotesque, it was the issues. Indeed, even what Trump said about grabbing women by their genitals without their consent was not enough to turn Coulter against him. All the sexual assault allegations, the business fraud, and the complete lack of knowledge about how government and the world works did not sway Coulter at all. She voted for Trump and sang his praises by writing books in support of him.Even the evidence that Trump is not even close to being the deal maker he bragged to be was not enough. Yet, Coulter is now whining about how terrible Trump is at negotiating as if she wasn t previously warned. Where is the great negotiation?  she asked.  Where is the bull in the china shop we wanted? That budget the Republicans pushed through was like a practical joke  Did we win anything? And this is the great negotiator? Coulter then conceded that  things don t look good  and compared Trump s presidency to a road trip gone wrong.It s not like I m out yet, but boy, things don t look good. I ve said to other people,  It s as if we re in Chicago and Trump tells us he s going to get us to LA in six days. But for the first three days we are driving towards New York. Yes, it is true he can still turn around and get us to LA in three days, but I m a little nervous.Coulter even admits that at least one thing Trump has done is fascist.I have from the beginning been opposed to Trump hiring any of his relatives. Americans don t like that, I don t like that. That s the one fascist thing he s done. Hiring his kids.Yeah, never mind the deportation force that is literally rounding up Latinos like the Nazis did to the Jews. Never mind the fact Trump has signed executive orders targeting people just because of their religious beliefs. Never mind the fact that Trump is aligned with the interests of corporations. Never mind that he treats women like shit. Never mind that he has repeatedly attacked the free press and uses Fox News as his personal propaganda machine. Coulter thinks Trump has just done one fascist thing by giving his daughter an office in the White House. Somebody needs to give Coulter a refresher course on what fascism is.Trump s poll numbers continue to drop and his policies are set to destroy millions of lives and put the world on course for World War III but Coulter still isn t ready to turn against him just yet despite using words like  nightmare  and  disaster  to describe Trump s tenure thus far.I ll say we had no choice, but the Trump-haters were right It s a nightmare. I can t even contemplate that. Right now I m still rooting for him to turn around and take us toward LA It s just that it has been such a disaster so far.But Coulter did have a choice. The Republican field of candidates in 2016 was bigger than it ever has been. She literally had over a dozen choices. But she chose a whining loudmouth ignoramus over candidates like Jeb Bush or John Kasich, who would have been far better and saner than Trump. She just wants to watch the world burn and she is disappointed that Trump hasn t destroyed it fast enough.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 15, 2017"

There s also the cringeworthy sex joke he once made while sitting next to Ivanka as the two sat down for an interview.But it s not just Trump. His friends are equally weird about their daughters.Enter Michael Cohen, Trump s close friend and lawyer. On Twitter, Cohen chose to celebrate his daughter s  Ivy League  education by posting a picture of the young woman wearing just a bra and pantyhose.So proud of my Ivy League daughter brains and beauty channeling her Edie Sedgwick. On Instagram @samichka_ pic.twitter.com/mpQxhr3mh3  Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) May 15, 2017Why he chose to focus on her  beauty  and not her  brains  when bragging about her college choice is anyone s guess. Further upping the ick factor, Cohen started responding to critics who were calling him out for the weird photo choice. He suggested they were just jealous that his daughter was so hot.Nearly 12 hours later, Cohen has yet to delete a tweet in which he claims people are jealous that his own daughter is  spank bank material.  As one Twitter user put it:@MichaelCohen212 @bonibrat Jealous? No  Creeped the fuck out? Yup! That s your DAUGHTER!  The MIXX (@TheMIXXRadio) May 15, 2017Like Ivanka, Cohen s daughter seems to be sticking with her father during this father-daughter controversy. In a bizarre move, she retweeted his  jealous  comment and later claimed the whole controversy came from hypocritical Trump haters.  Sure This creepy exchange notwithstanding, Cohen is a piece of work for many reasons. Ostensibly a practicing lawyer, Cohen has repeatedly demonstrated his inability to grasp even basic legal concepts. He struggles even harder with moral ones, particularly when it comes to women. When Trump s ex-wife described how Trump once raped her while the two were married, Cohen argued that wives couldn t be raped by their husbands  by definition. Michael Cohen, special counsel at The Trump Organization, defended his boss, saying,  You re talking about the frontrunner for the GOP, presidential candidate, as well as a private individual who never raped anybody. And, of course, understand that by the very definition, you can t rape your spouse. Despite his dubious legal bona fides, Cohen remains in Trump s orbit because the pair are fiercely loyal to one another.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"May 15, 2017"
 The Polls From Trump’s Horrific Week Have Been Released And He’s In A Complete Tailspin,"A recent opinion poll carried out by NBC News/Wall Street Journal showed that 78 percent of Americans, a number that appears to still be growing, would prefer to see an independent commissioner or special prosecutor handle the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 US presidential election, while a mere 15 percent believe congress can handle any ongoing probe.Last week was more than just a turbulent time in Washington. President Trump fired FBI head James Comey on Tuesday, the man responsible for the investigation into Trump s Russian ties. This latest poll was conducted between Thursday, May 11 and Saturday, May 13, just days after Comey s ousting, among 800 adults and has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The firing of the FBI director was a major upheaval in the investigation process, and these poll results reflect the current climate not only around Capitol Hill, but what is a rapidly growing consensus across the nation.Since Comey s dismissal, Trump and several members of his administration have tried to downplay the need for an independent commission to continue what the FBI had begun; looking into questions of Russian interference in last year s election, as well as the possibility of members of Trump s campaign colluding with Moscow. In fact, on Saturday the President stated in no uncertain terms that the investigation should continue to progress in the House, the Senate, the FBI. According to the same poll, only 29 percent of Americans say they approve of Comey s firing, while 38 percent disapprove. Another 32 percent of respondents don t have enough to say on the matter, yet among those who say they have read, seen or heard  a lot  about the firing, 53 percent say they disapprove, versus 33 percent who approve. The poll also showed a partisan split when it comes to the topic of the president s decision, with 58 percent of Republicans approving while 66 percent of Democrats disapprove of the move. One thing that is clear, however, is that very few people surveyed had no opinion at all, with low single-digit responses.As a whole, Trump s approval rating has remained steady at 39 percent since last Tuesday, however, 30 percent of those surveyed claimed that their impression of the president is less favorable since his decision to remove James Comey, while 61 percent say the move hasn t impacted their impression of President Trump whatsoever.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"May 15, 2017"
 James Clapper Just Publicly Said Trump Is Destroying Our Democracy (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has been throwing around the false claim that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that there was  no evidence  of collusion between him and his campaign and Russia recently, but a CNN interview just destroyed any hope of Trump ever using that again.On Sunday, Clapper told Jake Tapper that Donald Trump and his Russian friends are attacking our democracy: I think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally   and that s the big news here is the Russian interference in our election system   and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally. Asked if he meant Donald Trump, Clapper responded with one word:  Exactly. The founding fathers, in their genius, created a system of three co-equal branches of government and a built-in system of checks and balances,  Clapper said, adding,  I feel as though that is under assault and is eroding. I think each Senator or Congressman has got to, I hope, will think in terms of their own conscience,  Clapper told Tapper.  I hope they speak up. Clapper also said that Trump is wrong to use him to exonerate himself. The bottom line is I don t know if there was collusion, political collusion,  Clapper said.  I don t know of any evidence to it. So I can t refute it, and I can t confirm it. Watch the interview below:",News,"May 14, 2017"
 Chris Wallace SCOLDS Fox News Colleagues For Not Covering Comey Firing Seriously (VIDEO),"The hosts of Fox & Friends just got their asses handed to them by one of their own colleagues for protecting Donald Trump so much.For months, the FBI have been investigating Trump s Russia scandal. The scandal continues to grow every day and when Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last week it became and even bigger story.Trump literally fires the head of the agency that is investigating him, which means he interfered in a federal investigation and committed obstruction of justice. The firing also smacks of Watergate because former President Nixon did something similar in an effort to cover up his involvement in the crime.Clearly, Trump is desperately trying to bury the Russia investigation and he is willing to fire people to do it.But Fox & Friends have been Trump s top cheerleaders for months now and they continued in that role after Comey s firing, writing off the story as just mainstream media  hysteria. But they weren t able to get away with it on Sunday while respected journalist and fellow Fox host Chris Wallace was around.Prior to his own show, Wallace made a guest appearance on the morning program and proceeded to scold Pete Hegseth for downplaying Comey s firing. It s been about Russian collusion from the beginning,  Hegseth whined.  His critics have tried to make him look not legitimate. And five days after the firing of Comey, the media is still chomping at the bit with hysteria. Hegseth then played clips focusing more on what Democratic lawmakers have been saying as proof that the media is being  hysterical.  Wallace took immediate offense and defended the media while letting Trump s top propaganda team know that, in fact, this is a major story. But I do take exception to the idea that this is hysteria,  Wallace said. There are some cases there that I shake my head and think that s over the top. Yes. This is a big story. The fact that we re continuing to talk about it a week later. This is the first time in history that a president has fired an FBI director who was conducting an investigation that was directly investigating him and his associates. It s a big story and I think it s a legitimate story to cover. Here s the video via YouTube.So while hacks like the hosts of Fox & Friends are doing Trump s bidding by trying to delegitimize a big story that further highlights how corrupt Trump is, Chris Wallace isn t willing to buy the bullshit they are selling and has no problem calling out them out for not doing their job. If only more Fox hosts were like Chris Wallace, Trump would be in deeper shit.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"May 14, 2017"
 KKK Style Mob Chants “Russia Is Our Friend” While Protesting Confederate Statue Removal (VIDEO),"In a scene reminiscent of a horrifying KKK rally, a torch mob chanted highly racist slogans as they descended on a park Saturday night in Charlottesville, Virginia.The crowd claiming to protect their  white heritage  shouted  All White Lives Matter,  and  No More Brother Wars,  in reaction to the proposed removal of the Virginia town park s confederate statue.They were also heard chanting Russia is our friend,  and  You will not replace us.  The protesters also lit tiki torches as it became dark. I m her to take part in this great celebration of our heritage and to say  no  to the city of Charlottesville. You re not going to tear down our statue and you re not going to replace us,  said Richard Spence, white nationalist leader.You ll remember Spence as the asshole who was punched in the face on inauguration day in D.C. Spence lead this protest which received a lot of community backlash   from the same people who are against taking down the statue. This event involving torches at night in Lee Park was either profoundly ignorant or was designed to instill fear in our minority populations in a way that hearkens back to the days of the KKK,  said Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer, who opposed removing the statues.Listen, Singer, if you disagree with the actions of touch-wielding racists mob, why do you oppose removing the hate-fueling racist statue? I guess it s ok to be racists in Charlottesville as long as you re not holding a torch.Here s the video, courtesy of MSNBC:Featured Image Via Embedded Video Screengrab",News,"May 14, 2017"
 Trump Gives Newt Gingrich’s Wife Job As Vatican Ambassador In Latest Bit Of Overt Corruption,"Following a pattern of handing jobs to the wives of his best friends, Trump is set to name Callista Gingrich the United States Ambassador to the Vatican   a job she is, naturally, completely unqualified for.Callista Gingrich, the wife of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, is the preferred nominee to be the next ambassador to the Vatican.As is typical of Trump, he seems to have given little thought to Callista s actual experience before deciding to hook her up with the job. Gingrich s entire  career  section on Wikipedia is three sentences. She hasn t held a job in over a decade. She s never worked in diplomacy. The last of one she had, as a clerk at the House Agriculture Committee, erupted in scandal when it was exposed that Gingrich   so instrumental in pushing for Bill Clinton s impeachment   had been having a six year affair with Callista while the pair worked in Washington.Her only real qualification is that she is a devout Catholic. In fact, despite her starting a relationship with Newt in a lengthy affair, she made him get an annulment of his last marriage in order to get right in the eyes of the Catholic church. Because Newt had been married for 19 years, the couple came up with a particularly disgusting way to justify it. They claimed the 19-year marriage was never valid because Newt s ex-wife had been previously married. (Indeed, Newt had also been previously married but a mixture of misogyny and hypocrisy allowed them to ignore that.)As Trump s corruption scandals continue to grow, he is reportedly retreating further into his close circle of  loyal  enablers. After firing the FBI director for, in part, not pledging loyalty to Trump or listening to his order to drop the Russia investigation, sources in the White House have said that the replacement prospects are being assessed based on their willingness to be Trump s lapdog.Here s a typical rundown:Mr. Trump and his advisers have asked some people whether they believe Mr. Kelly, the former New York police commissioner, would be  loyal,  language similar to what he used in questioning Mr. Comey s effectiveness, according to people briefed on the discussions.Hiring the family members of his allies helps keep those allies loyal. Mitch McConnell s wife, Elaine Chou, is now the Secretary of Transportation. Mike Huckabee s daughter is the deputy press secretary. Trump s own closest adviser is married to his daughter.As a man who walks a very tight rope between impeachment, Trump s impulse seems to be to keep his friends so locked up in his administration that they wouldn t dare move against him. If Newt or Mitch McConnell tried to call for his removal, they would be dooming their own wives along with him. It s a bold play, and corrupt as hell.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News,"May 14, 2017"
 Did Trump Go Full Nixon? Former Employees Reportedly Saw Him Taping Conversations,"Amateur president Donald Trump sent out a threatening tweet targeting former FBI Director James Comey and it s backfiring. Trump tweeted,  James Comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  Members of Congress have demanded that the former reality show star hand over the alleged tapes for the review. At this moment, team Trump has declined in interviews to address whether tapes exist or not and Comey, for his part, doesn t seem concerned about it. The question over if they exist can be answered by three of Trump s former employees.The former employees and a former associate said it wasn t a surprise to them that Trump would mention taped conversations.The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump sometimes taped phone conversations with associates and others from his Trump Tower office in New York when he was a businessman, according to three people who say they have direct knowledge of the recordings.The former employees said that they were fearful of using their names and another employee said that he had signed a nondisclosure agreement. We do know that the former high-level employees worked for Trump over a span of three decades, so it appears they knew of the goings on at his office and they added that they saw devices in use recording phone calls.It wasn t just three employees.A fourth person said he knew that Mr. Trump had recorded a phone conversation with him because it was later entered into evidence in a lawsuit.During a Fox News interview Friday, Trump was asked whether there might be tape recordings of Comey as he suggested. Trump said,  That I can t talk about. I won t talk about that. Former President Richard Nixon fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor assigned to the investigation into his scandal. Sound familiar? The night Cox was fired was called the  Saturday Night Massacre.  Nixon refused Cox s request to release the tapes. Instead, Nixon fired him.Ultimately, Nixon resigned before he could be impeached. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, mandated that the White House release the subpoenaed tapes.The firing of Cox shocked America because it was the first time a president had ever brazenly and abruptly fired an official charged with investigating a president s conduct before. And now it s 2017, and Trump just shocked America by firing the man leading the investigation into his administration s alleged ties to Russia. Before Comey, it was Preet Bharara, then Sally Yates. History repeats itself.It s only a matter of time before we hear Trump say,  I am not a crook! Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News,"May 14, 2017"
" Texas Moving To Ban Jews, Muslims, and Gays from Adopting","Texas parents looking to adopt may soon be banned by private and state-funded agencies that object to people who are Muslim, Jewish, single, gay, or interfaith couples, under a proposal from the Republican-controlled legislature, according to a report by the Associated Press.Similar laws have been passed in five states allowing adoption organizations the ability to refuse gay parents or members of certain religions the right to adopt. The difference is the Texas rule extends the allowable discrimination to state-funded agencies.Republicans say the bill is designed to support foster care provider and adoption agency religious freedom, many which receive funding from the state.Opponents of the proposal are vocal about it robbing children of stable families and using taxpayer dollars to discriminate against hopeful parents. This would allow adopting agencies to turn away qualified, loving parents who are perhaps perfect in every way because the agency has a difference in religious belief. It goes against the best interest of the child.  said the Human Rights Campaign senior legislative counsel, Catherine Oakley. The bill also blatantly violates the Constitution. As a governmental entity, Texas is bound to treat people equally under the law,  states Oakley.  This is a violation of equal protection under the law. An Austin-based attorney Suzanne Bryant who works with LGBTQ clients explains that in addition to using religious freedom to turn away parents looking to adopt, it could also force foster children to comply with these discriminatory requirements.Unfortunately, this could mean welfare organizations have the ability to send LGBTQ children to conversion therapy, which the American Health Organization considers a  serious threat to the health and well-being of affected people.  They could also prevent access to contraception and abortions for young people in the system.This is sad news for hopeful adoptive parents and children in Texas, and a blatant violation of the constitution.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"May 14, 2017"
 Kellyanne Conway Just Can’t Stop Talking About Anderson Cooper’s Eye Roll (VIDEO),"With nothing else important going on in the world, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway doubled-down on Anderson Cooper because she s so offended that he rolled his eyes during an interview a few days ago in which she tried to defend her boss over the bizarre timing of James Comey s termination as Director of the FBI. Just like last Thursday, Conway again said that Cooper was  probably sexist  because he rolled his eyes. Last Thursday, instead of addressing the issue at hand, Conway brought up Trump s election victory in Michigan, but the subject was Comey. I turned [the question] around as I often do,  Conway told Fox News host Howard Kurtz.  And he rolled his eyes, possibly sexist   definitely, what I call Trumpist, which many people who go on TV are treated like house guests. And then when we go on TV, we re not. Conway said that there s a  quest to go viral  with interviewers when they tell White House staffers that their arguments  make no sense  or say that they  must be lying. It really doesn t help democracy,  she said.  We re faced with people with the feigned, pained look; the furrowed brow, the curled lip anytime someone tries to say something, including the president. The obsession with every [Trump] tweet and every comment,  Conway whined.  And not covering the jobs numbers, not covering the amazing trade deal that we just made with China. It s like,  Trade deal on beef with China. Yawn.  That s news! Watch:Coway is triggered over an eye roll which she deems to be  sexist  while she works for a man who thinks grabbing women by their genitals is OK if you re in a powerful position. Conway went to her safe place at Fox News to talk about an eye roll while her boss, Donald J. Trump, is plagued with scandals. Team Trump isn t even good at deflecting anymore.As far as Conway s claim that people are obsessed over Trump s tweets, it s conservatives who have recently agreed with the alleged president   he should cancel all press briefings and just use Twitter. So, yeah, his tweets are important and he uses the social site as his podium. Words mean things. Well, they used to   before Trump.Image via screen capture. ",News,"May 14, 2017"
 Alec Baldwin And Melissa McCarthy Probably Just Put The Final Nail In Sean Spicer’s Coffin (VIDEO),"Everyone knows that Donald Trump absolutely HATES Melissa McCarthy s portrayal of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Well, this week s edition of SNL certainly will not please The Donald, because McCarthy s  Spicey  came back with a vengeance.The segment opened with Aidy Bryant doing an absolutely PERFECT impression of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the Deputy Press Secretary and daughter of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, filling in for Spicer as she has been doing all week since Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and sent Washington reeling once again. Huckabee Sanders  points out that she is doing  Spicer s  job because he is on Naval Reserve duty. However, in this episode, he is outside in the bushes, just as the real Sean Spicer did in a pathetic attempt to hide from reporters after the Comey news broke. Bryant s Huckabee Sanders insisted that this was part of a Naval Reserve exercise, though.Then, a couple of members of the White House Press Corps asked if  Huckabee Sanders  could replace  Spicer  permanently. Before she could answer,  Spicer  bursts in with a fire extinguisher and blasts a reporter s pants with it, insinuating that he was lying by pointing out all of  Spicer s  flaws.A reliably contentious press conference followed, focusing on the fallout from the Comey situation, just as press briefings have all week in real time. After Spicer finally ends the briefing abruptly, he rides to New York City to find Alec Baldwin s Trump. Of course,  Trump  is not at Trump Tower, so he then continues on to one of Trump s golf properties, where he asks Trump if he is about to be replaced by his Deputy Press Secretary. Trump  assures Spicey that he is safe, and then gives him a dramatic kiss   the kiss of death.The real Donald Trump is going to be absolutely furious with this. Further, rabidly homophobic Mike Pence will insist that Spicer has to go now that SNL has taken to mocking him and Trump with same-sex kisses.This will definitely fall under the heading   in Trump s mind, of course   of making his employee look weak.I d be willing to bet we ve seen just about the last of the real life Spicey. That isn t so bad, though I will miss Melissa McCarthy s version.Watch the hilarious segment below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 14, 2017"
 Half The World’s Salmon Supply Threatened As Trump’s EPA Withdraws Alaskan Mining Restrictions,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gave the go-ahead on Friday for a massive copper and gold mining operation to seek permits to mine the headwaters of an Obama-era protected world-class fishery in southwest Alaska.After an agreement through a court settlement, the EPA will start withdrawing restrictions on mining development in the Bristol Bay region, a pristine Alaskan fishery that provides the world with half of its sockeye salmon.This unfortunate agreement comes only four months after Trump came into office, which the Pebble mine supporters hoped would be their ticket to big money through Trump s promises of environmental deregulation.Environmental rights groups are worried this agreement will act as a dangerous precedent for industry to challenge the EPA in court on environmental issues they previously wouldn t have gone after during the Obama Administration. It obviously sends a psychological message to big mining companies that if they were nervous about getting permits in the past   that this is their golden opportunity to get their mine through the process.  said Brett Harti, the government affairs director for the center for biological Diversity environment group.It s being called a  backdoor deal  by critics and a  slap in the face  to the citizens of the Bristol Bay region who petitioned to keep the region protected.The Pebble company sued the EPA in federal court claiming the agency colluded with environmental groups to block the mining project. The suit followed an EPA study that concluded the proposed large-scale mining posed a siginificant risk to the region s salmon and cause adverse effects to Alaskan Natives who based their culture around the salmon resources in the area. The EPA inspector general found no evidence that the EPA predetermined the outcome of the study in any way. Protecting Bristol Bay from the Pebble Mine has been a priority issue for the hook-and-bullet community for 10 years. This was a real test for President Trump, who said all the right things to sportsmen during the election,  said Scott Hed, the director of the Sportsman s Alliance for Alaska. This is a direct assault on our values. America s hunters and anglers are extremely disappointed but we will not let up in the fight to protect Bristol Bay.

 Comey’s 9-Year Old Neighbor Just SHAMED Trump And His Temperament With This AMAZING Gesture,"Former FBI Director James Comey is, no doubt, just trying to get on with his life right now after being unceremoniously stripped of his job by an administration prone to temper tantrums worthy of three-year old children. Press and others are apparently camped outside Comey s Virginia home, and one of his very young neighbors thinks that just isn t right. So she decided to see if she could brighten his day with a little gift   fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies.So how is this little girl, named Abby, more mature than an old man named Donald Trump? Well, besides the obvious problems with Trump and his hypersensitive response to everything, it s the reason why she delivered cookies to Comey. Her mother told a reporter that Abby said: We ve spent a lot of time talking about how kindness and empathy are the most important ways for us to engage [with] people regardless of if we agree with or understand their positions.In [Director] Comey s case, Abby said  I wanted him to know we respect him for his career of service. That s not all, though. Abby actually sent a note with the cookies that said: We are proud to be your neighbor and thank you for all you have done for America. Love: Abby Grace. Reports from the White House saying Comey had lost the respect of his rank-and-file agents seem to be inaccurate and designed to prop up Trump s decision, made in the heat of a tantrum where Trump was just fed up with having someone in his service who wouldn t fall meekly in line behind him. In other words, Trump and his minions basically lied in order to make that tantrum look like a legit dismissal, rather than Trump stomping his feet and screaming,  Wah wah wah!! Comey won t play by my rules! He s being a big meanie-head! Trump demonstrated his schoolyard-bully mentality when he threatened Comey over Twitter:James Comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017Abby wasn t having any of it. Her mother told reporters this, too: FBI Director Comey lives in our neighborhood, and, as you would imagine   there were a lot of reporters at the foot of his driveway today. Abby thought that was quite inhospitable. Lots of reporters haunting your driveway can make you want to stay inside all the time just to avoid answering the same questions over and over and being generally hounded. In Comey s case, those questions probably involve things he can t actually discuss. Abby must have felt that Comey needed a pick-me-up: Well   either a 9 year old in a parochial school uniform dress doesn t look very threatening- or the smell of the choc chip cookies was so good that the security detail could smell them from the other side of the gate  . in either case, Abby Grace just hand delivered a dozen cookies fresh from the oven. She walked up, shook the hand of the 6 10  agent, introduced herself, and, hopefully made Director Comey s day a little bit better! We hope so, too. To be clear, Abby didn t do this to shame Trump, she did it because she hoped it would make her neighbor feel better. That s what makes it so awesome, and why it puts Trump to a high level of shame.Featured image by Molly Riley-Pool via Getty Images",News,"May 13, 2017"
 Lindsey Graham: Trump Should Be Treated With The Same Respect Republicans Gave Obama,"We re wondering if Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) is OK. He just doesn t seem to be himself lately. The South Carolina Republican was so fiercely critical of alleged president Donald Trump, but that s all suddenly changed now. Graham, who once called Trump a  jackass,  praised the amateur president on Saturday as a leader who is open-minded  and is even willing to reach out for help, even late at night, according to the Washington Examiner. What have I learned about our president? He s curious, he asks questions, and he knows no fear,  Graham said in his remarks at the South Carolina Republican convention.  And he s under siege unlike any president I ve ever seen in my entire life   They don t believe he won; I do. Now Obama was somewhat hard for us, but I thought we were somewhat respectful,  Graham added without one bit of irony whatsoever.Graham then went to on to disrespect former President Barack Obama by calling him a  community organizer who apologized for America every turn all over the world. Let me tell you that you have a commander in chief that s not going to let this country get walked over anymore,  he said.And that s really cute, don t you think? He said that of Obama who had 20 years of experience under his belt before taking the job as President while praising a former reality show star who had zero experience in politics. He calls and I m honored that he would call me and I want to help him,  he said.  He calls me when I m asleep and he calls me after I go to bed. I wish he would rest more. I gave him my phone number. So far so good. It s nice he has a cozy relationship with a man who just recently penned him a letter to assure him that he has no connections to Russia. Lindsey Graham requested that information. Trump s lawyers said in the letter that a review of the last 10 years of Trump s tax returns revealed that he has no income from Russia  with a few exceptions. Here s the kicker: The law firm who sent the letter actually has deep ties to   wait for it   Russia. Lindsey Graham appeared to be that one Republican with a spine willing to call out the White House, but now he s rolling over while claiming that Republicans respected Obama. Democrats are just being big ol  meanies to the man who is plagued in scandals while only 120ish days into the job.Trump, for the record, is the same man who dogged Obama for years, insisting that our first black President was actually a scary Muslim from Kenya. Obama did not have conflicts of interest. The biggest scandal at this same amount of time during Obama s presidency was that he put Dijon mustard on his hamburger. That was the big scandal featured on Fox News for a week. In contrast, Trump has a massive amount of conflicts of interest.Sure, Lindsey, we ll give Trump the same respect Republicans gave Obama.

 Desperate Trump Considers Dumping Spicer For Fox News Host,"Desperate to look better in the public eye after the media frenzy surrounding the firing of James Comey, President Trump is looking for help from Fox News, according to a report from the Associated Press.According to this report, an anonymous White House official says Trump is  Mulling expanding the communications team and has eyed hiring producers from Fox News.  We ve seen how angry Trump became from the fallout of his Comey firing, and according to the both the New York Times and the Associated Press, Trump is blaming the disaster on his communications team. The report states that according to personal relations of the president, he  increasingly sees himself as the White House s only effective spokesperson. The White House is scrambling to make excuses and sources told the AP that the President  does not believe his team gave contradictory stories about his decision to fire Comey, despite the fact that the White House s explanation changed dramatically over a 48-hour period. Two White House sources spoke out over Trump s  overly harsh criticism  of press secretary Sean Spicer, and others revealed that Trump has been discussing replacing Spicer because of his dissatisfaction with Spicer. According to some to Trump allies, he may even be considering Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle.The longtime Trump ally Sean Hannity from Fox News has said in response to the Comey fallout that Trump should stop having White House press briefings altogether. If the propaganda destroy-Trump media  if they re gonna smear and slander him and his administration and his family and lie about facts and what he s done, why bother,  said Hannity.  Why waste the energy trying to appease people who obviously hate his guts and want to destroy him. We ll see how far Trump goes to destroy the media s role in governmental checks and balances to save face in light of his latest scandal.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"May 13, 2017"
 Dan Rather Brilliantly Rips Trump’s Lawless Week In SCATHING Facebook Post,"Donald Trump has had what is arguably the most bizarre week in the history of the American presidency. He has careened from outrage to outrage, lie to lie, and lawless action to lawless action   all in the span of five days, starting with his firing of FBI Director James Comey because he threw a massive tantrum over the Trump-Russia collusion investigation. Well, there is one respected American who has had about enough of Trump s acting as if he is above the law: journalist Dan Rather.Rather took to his Facebook page to rip Trump to shreds as only he can. He begins by talking about how long he s lived and how many presidencies he s lived through   including Richard Nixon s   and then moves on to the extraordinary disgrace that is the Donald Trump presidency. Rather says, in part:But I have never seen a week where a president of our nation has behaved with such a cavalier disregard for the norms and institutions of our democracy. And it now seems like the investigation is expanding into Trump s business dealings. The comparisons with Richard Nixon are plentiful these days, but even he did not seem so untethered from our basic governance. And I have never seen so many members of a political party rally around incompetence, intemperance, and inanity.Dan Rather is correct. Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon look like a boy scout. Trump is downright dangerous, and he must be restrained. If only the Congress would do their jobs and speak out, and act as the check on this president that they are supposed to be. Hell, they were more than happy to be a check on President Obama   and he didn t even do anything that was lawless.This is the Republican Party putting partisan politics and their own political futures above the good of the republic. It is shameful, and that is why we must vote them out of Congress in 2018.Mr. Rather, thank you for speaking truth to power. We need voices like yours in these dark and dire times.Read the entire brilliant post below:Featured image via Kirk Irwin/Getty Images for SiriusXM",News,"May 13, 2017"
 Warren Drags Trump Sideways In Brutal Commencement Speech — It’s Beautiful (VIDEO),"If there s one Democrat that Donald Trump is scared sh*tless of, it s Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Warren was a massive thorn in Trump s side during his presidential campaign, and she certainly hasn t let up after he got into the White House. And now that Trump has pissed Democrats off by firing FBI Director James Comey, he s probably regretful that one of them is Warren.Warren s feelings about Trump s shady firing of Comey were made known on Friday, when Warren gave a commencement address at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. During her speech, she basically wiped the floor with Trump, encouraging the UMass graduates to get involved in political causes and join the resistance. Warren slammed Trump s firing of Comey when she said: I m trying to keep this apolitical but I can t help myself   the principle that no one, no one in this country is above the law and we need a Justice Department, not an obstruction of justice department. And she didn t stop there. Warren made sure to criticize all of Trump s helpers equally, even mocking Kellyanne Conway for her  alternative facts.  Warren joked: Go online and read the facts, not the alternative facts the real facts. I have to say I had never thought we would need a modifier for facts. Warren made sure to trash the spineless Republicans that have helped Trump succeed as well. Zeroing in on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Warren observed that nudging graduates to get involved in policy wouldn t make her  Ms. Popularity.  Then she quipped: I think as long as Mitch McConnell is running the Senate that s out of reach for me. This was a speech where Warren let loose on the GOP and Trump administration, and we couldn t be more proud. Warren has been a powerful voice in fighting Trump s disgraceful agenda, and we need her to inspire America s youth more than ever.

 BUSTED: Trump’s Pick For Top USDA Scientist Is NOT A Scientist At All,"The USDA, responsible for everything from our food safety to climate change, is soon to get a new Chief Scientist who under the 2008 Farm Bill will be chosen  from among distinguished scientist with significant experience in agricultural research, education, and economics.  The problem is, Trump s choice for this high-responsibility position is Sam Clovis, who has none of these credentials.Clovis is a business professor at Morningside College, is publicly skeptical of climate change and has never even taken a science course during his graduate studies. What s worse is that he is most known for being a conservative talk show radio host for  Impact with Sam Clovis  in Iowa. Touting that the only reason Obama wasn t impeached was because of his race, he came out as a fierce pro-Trump advocate while running an unsuccessful camping for Senate in 2014.As the current senior White House advisor for the USDA, Clovis has been described as  Trump s eyes and ears  at the agency. Clovis also takes credit for recruiting Carter Page, Trump s foreign policy advisor who s being scrutinized for his ties to Russia.The appointment of Clovis as the USDA Chief Scientist was compared to appointing someone without any medical credentials to lead the National Institutes of Health, by Obama Administration Scientists.Clovis has expressed repeatedly that he does not believe in climate change, and has called efforts for climate action  simply a mechanism for transferring wealth from one group of people to another.  He has promised that the Trump USDA will take a new direction, focusing on lessening regulation and boosting trade, rather than addressing climate change.Catherine Woteki, a Ph.D. holder in nutrition and the USDA s undersecretary for research states,  access to safe food and clean air and water is absolutely fundamental to personal security,  and adding that scientific research is critical to the job.  Food system are widely recognized by the national security community as being part of critical infrastructure. It looks like our access to safe food, fresh water, and clean air are now in the hands of non-scientists who wants to use the USDA for capital gains instead of the security of our natural resources.Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"May 13, 2017"
 It’s ON: Comey Refuses To Testify Before Intelligence Committee Unless The Hearing Is Public,"When former FBI director James Comey refused to testify before Congress in a closed session, it seemed odd to many who have been paying attention to the Donald Trump/Russia scandal. Comey was fired shortly after requesting more funding for the investigation into Trump and his associates  likely collusion with Russia. In Comey s termination letter, Donald Trump thanked him for confirming three times that he was not under investigation   though Comey s colleagues say no such thing happened.According to numerous reports, Comey had begun receiving daily   rather than weekly   reports on the investigation in the time before he was fired. So why was he unwilling to testify? Because he wants this shit to go down in public.One of Comey s associates strategically leaked to the New York Times that Comey would be willing to speak :Mr. Comey made no comment, but later in the day he declined a request to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. According to a close associate of Mr. Comey, he is willing to testify, but wants it to be in public.The matter arose in a series of early-morning Twitter messages in which Mr. Trump appeared agitated over news reports on contradictory accounts of his decision to fire Mr. Comey, which came at the same time the F.B.I. is investigating ties between Mr. Trump s associates and Russia. Among other things, he threatened to cancel future White House briefings.The White House s original version of the story was that the president had acted on the recommendation of the attorney general and deputy attorney general and fired Mr. Comey because of his handling of last year s investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails. But in an interview with NBC News on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he had already decided to fire Mr. Comey and would have done so regardless of any recommendation. He also indicated that he was thinking about the Russia investigation when he decided.What does Comey know? Trump, who demanded a loyalty pledge multiple times that the ousted director turned down, recently threatened to release  tapes  of their conversations. Trump did not say what was on these alleged tapes, but The Donald s Nixonian outburst reveals that he s incredibly nervous about whatever it is that Comey knows.As for Comey? He hopes there are tapes.A source close to Comey told me this morning:  He hopes there are tapes. That would be perfect.

 Chris Wallace Just Shoved His Foot So Far Up Trump’s Ass It Came Out His Mouth (VIDEO),"Donald Trump may spend his time furiously tweeting that the Russia investigation   the one over which he fired FBI Director James Comey after he requested additional resources   is FAKE NEWS, while simultaneously complaining about leaks of classified information that is simultaneously FAKE NEWS and real information, but the rest of us see through his actions that not only is our alleged President hiding about a billion skeletons in his closet, but he has sold out our nation. This is, at this point, something that can be considered a truth   because even Fox News can t avoid commenting on The Donald and his administration s shady practices. When I heard that exchange today between Jeff Mason, White House reporter, and Sean Spicer speaking from the podium in the briefing room for the President of the United States, it took my breath away,  Wallace told fellow Fox host Shep Smith on Friday, adding:That was what in Watergate they called a non-denial denial. He was asked specifically, is there a recording device in the Oval Office of the President of the United States? He said,  I have nothing for you on that.  He could have said no. He could have said yes. He said I have nothing for you on that. That is a non-denial denial. Look, it may just be that the President is trolling the press corps and saying work yourself into a frenzy about this and turns out it nothing. But why would he do that? Why would he want to decrease the credibility which is already in question of this White House and comments that are made from that podium? It seems to me that you re playing a very dangerous game with the currency of the credibility of the President of the United States. Every step he s taken this week has cut into the credibility of this White House, the trust of the people inside the White House,  Wallace said,  and clearly I think the trust that the American people pay to this President and to his White House staff. I ve never seen anything like it and I find it very troubling and troubled. I just don t understand the game that they re playing,  he added.  Cause it isn t a game.

" Michelle Obama TORCHES Donald Trump: ‘It’s Not About Politics, It’s About Parenting!’","Barack and Michelle Obama are incredibly smart, articulate and charming. They came from relatively modest backgrounds and the Obama administration was nearly completely scandal free. So why wouldn t Republicans vote for the man whose only real promise was to be the anti-Obama?Well, they got the anti-Obama. Donald Trump is rude, crude and without class or charm. His IQ, or at least his communication skills, are below that of your average 5th grader and in fewer than four months, he has racked up more scandals than any President in history, On the governing front, we ll he s been the anti-Obama there too. He s trying to overturn every single Obama accomplishment, including Michelle s efforts at ensuring that poor children receive at least some nutrition at school, which for Republicans, is a step too far.Now, the Trump administration is putting a stop to those evil healthy lunches. Agriculture Secretary Sunny Perdue is delaying requirements for schools to have reduced sodium in lunches and he is issuing waivers so schools won t have to serve whole grains. Yes, depriving children of healthy lunches is petty and petulant, but that s the way the Trump administration rolls, so Michelle Obama weighed in.Speaking at an annual health conference in Washington, D.C., Obama said more nutritious school lunches are important since millions of kids eat federally subsidized school breakfast and lunch. Without mentioning President Donald Trump, she said parents should stop and  think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap. If we want to make this country great, our kids need to be healthy,  Obama said.  Not some, but all. Source: NBC ChicagoMichelle also took aim at the GOP argument that she was helping to create a nanny state by attempting to regulate school lunches. In the perfectly crafted response, she pointed instead at the oligarchy, which lets corporations make the decisions for us: You want to talk about nanny state and government intervention, well,  you just buy the food and be quiet and you don t need to know what is in it,'  Obama said.  That is essentially what a move like this is saying to you moms. She even used Trump s own words against him, saying that if we want to Make America Great, we need healthy children.

" Ex-FBI Tears Trump To Pieces, Wonders ‘Who’s In Charge of This Country?’ (VIDEO)","All Americans, and indeed the entire world, should be very afraid of what is going on with Donald Trump s presidency. Many people have voiced those concerns publicly, and one of them is former FBI Special Agent Clinton Watts.On Friday, Watts appeared on MSNBC to discuss Trump s threatening tweet directed at now-former FBI Director James Comey, and his remarks were most extraordinary. First, he addressed Trump s tweet. He s threatening somebody he already fired. He would make passive threats to the FBI Director via Twitter before he fired him. He s saying he might taping recordings of you to use against you later. It s not the rule of law, it s the rule of Trump. Watts then turned to the fact that Trump really doesn t seem to be running the nation at all. This is evident to anyone watching the chaos unfold on a daily basis, of course. He continued: He s obviously not working right now or in charge, he s sitting watching TV and tweeting. Who is in charge of this country? This is a different level of seriousness, in terms of this tweet this morning. This is getting more and more grave by the day. Trump is drunk with power and abusing it. The White House is in chaos, its spokespeople seem to have no idea what to say to the American public. Everyone in the administration lies routinely to the American public. And now, most grave of all, we have this out of control president threatening the man he just fired   a man who happened to be leading up an investigation into the president himself. The firing itself seems like obstruction of justice, and the threat is even worse.Congress, if ever there was a time for you to do your jobs and check and balance Donald Trump, it s now.

We ve all known that Republicans are pretty much the scum of the earth today, but Chomsky warns they are the most dangerous organization  in human history. During an interview with BBC s  Newsnight  Wednesday with host Evan Davis, Mr. Chomsky quickly addressed the Republican Party, saying that they are worse than the Islamic State terrorist group or anyone else who have caused millions of casualties during the 20th century.Chomsky agreed his statement was outrageous but made it hit home when comparing the Republican part to ISIS.  Is ISIS dedicated to trying to destroy the prospects for organized human existence? He went on to explain,  What does it mean to say not only are we not doing anything about climate change, but we re trying to accelerate the race to the precipice?  he said.  It doesn t matter whether they genuinely believe it or not if the consequence of that is,  let s use more fossil fuels, let s refuse to subsidize developing countries, let s eliminate regulations that reduce greenhouse gases.  If that s the consequence, that s extremely dangerous. Chomsky has a real point.

I have said from the get-go that I think a special prosecutor is the way to go, but now with what s happened it is the only way to go,  Schumer told reporters on Tuesday.Instead, McConnell said he would leave that up to the FBI   and let Jeff Sessions handpick Comey s  interim  (read: non-confirmed) FBI head, something that is not standard procedure.News: AG Sessions & Deputy AG Rosenstein interviewing potential interim FBI directors today, according to a DOJ official (@LauraAJarrett)  David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) May 10, 2017Another deeply disturbing sign they need a handpicked interim Director?

Even if a full-time replacement eventually comes along, the dysfunction and partisanship created in this scenario could make the entire case dissolve. If you were a witness who knew of criminal wrongdoing from someone on Trump s team and you just watched the FBI director get fired and replaced by someone handpicked by Trump s close friend would you want to come forward? It s clear Trump sure hopes not.McConnell is enabling all of this. As usual. In a show of loyalty to the president, McConnell slammed Democrats who had called for an independent investigation and instead went on a lengthy rant about Obamacare and what he thought of as  Democratic hypocrisy.

 Ex-CIA Official: Someone Needs To Give Trump A Binky And ‘Put Him In The Crib’ (VIDEO),"The current occupant of the White House took to his Twitter account on Friday to issue a threat to former FBI Director James Comey. According to  White House press secretary Sean Spicer, though, the threat wasn t really a threat.  That s not a threat,  Spicer said during the crazy-time press briefing.  He simply stated a fact. The tweet speaks for itself.  Well, former CIA official Philip Mudd somewhat agrees with Spicer. He said he s  breathing a sigh of relief  after Trump s Twitter storm because it can t be taken seriously. Mudd said that Trump cannot intimidate the FBI. You feel like you have to give the President of the United States a pacifier and a rattle and put him in the crib,  he told CNN s Kate Bolduan.Mudd called Trump s tweets  a joke.

James Comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  he wrote.For someone who called Trump s tweets a  joke,  Mudd certainly wasn t laughing. In fact, he seems pissed off at Trump s attempt to threaten the former FBI Director. You re threatening the FBI, who s in the midst of an investigation of presidential aides? The FBI s been around since 1908. The President of the United States has been around for three and a half months,  Mudd said. If you think you re going to intimidate the former FBI director and the dozens of people in the workforce who are conducting this investigation with the Department of Justice, you ve got another thing coming,  he added.

 Watergate Reporter Says Trump’s Russia Scandal Is Way WORSE Than Watergate (DETAILS),"James Fallows has been a journalist since 1972 and he covered the Watergate scandal so he knows what he s talking about.And when Fallows says that Donald Trump s ongoing and ever-growing Russia scandal is WORSE than Watergate, every American should take notice.That s exactly what Fallows did in a new article for The Atlantic published on Friday.Fallows remembers the Watergate scandal clearly despite the fact that it unfolded 45 years ago.The scandal is known as the Watergate scandal because some of President Richard Nixon s goons broke into the Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate hotel.Nixon tried to cover up the crime by repeatedly lying and refusing to cooperate with investigations. He went so far as to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor assigned to the investigation. Cox wanted Nixon to release White House recordings and Nixon refused. Nixon wanted Cox to back off but Cox refused. Nixon then fired him. After that, it was all downhill for Nixon. The Supreme Court ordered him to release the tapes and they were so damning that Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.But Trump s Russia scandal is worse. Based simply on what is known so far, this scandal looks worse than Watergate,  Fallows wrote.  Worse for and about the president. Worse for the overall national interest. Worse in what it suggests about the American democratic system s ability to defend itself. Fallows points out that Watergate was a mere burglary in an effort to find information on Nixon s political opponents. Trump s scandal, on the other hand, is:Nothing less than attacks by an authoritarian foreign government on the fundamentals of American democracy, by interfering with an election and doing so as part of a sustained effort that included parallel interference in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and elsewhere. At worst, such efforts might actually have changed the election results. At least, they were meant to destroy trust in democracy. Not much of this is fully understood or proven, but the potential stakes are incomparably greater than what happened during Watergate, crime and cover-up alike.Fallows then compared Nixon s firing of Cox to Trump s firing of FBI Director James Comey.While Nixon  paid lip-service to the concept of due process and checks-and-balances  and at least acted like he was  sticking to some recognizable rules,  Trump s has openly disdained and flouted the rules. Nothing Donald Trump has done, on the campaign trail or in office, has expressed awareness of, or respect for, established rules,  Fallows continued.  Nixon s private comments could be vile, but nothing he said in public is comparable to Trump s dismissing James Comey as a  showboat,  or the thuggishly menacing tweet that Trump sent out today. The tweet Fallows referenced is a clear threat from Trump aimed at Comey in an effort to keep him from speaking to the press.James Comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017And while Nixon was a  dark and complex  person who was  deeply knowledgeable  and  publicly disciplined  and possessed  political and strategic intelligence,  Trump has repeatedly proven that  he is impulsive, and ignorant, and apparently beyond the reach of any control, even his own. And what s also worse about Trump s Russia scandal is the way Republicans have circled the wagons around Trump and have made attempt after attempt to bury any investigations into his misconduct.While Republicans like Jason Chaffetz, Mitch McConnell, and Devin Nunes have all tried to sabotage investigations on Trump s behalf, it was Republicans like Charles Wiggins, Barry Goldwater, and Howard Baker who put their country before party and sided against Nixon.The Republicans who turned against Nixon will be remembered for doing the right thing when their country needed them most. Today s Republicans will only be remembered for doing nothing while their country burned to the ground. Fallows even points out that all it would take is three brave Republicans in the Senate to join Democrats to get a truly independent investigation rolling.The question is whether they actually care about their country, the Constitution, and the integrity of the office of the presidency enough to do so.Our country needs heroes now more than ever. Republicans could be those heroes if they would just stop being cowards and stop being Trump s puppets.Featured Image: Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2017"
 Republicans Were Just Told To Stop Talking About Healthcare Repeal Because It’s Political Suicide (DETAILS),"Remember when Republicans were told to stop talking about rape because they were repeatedly sticking their foot in their mouths? Well, now they are being told to stop talking about their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Ever since Republicans giddily started preparing to repeal the landmark healthcare law, they faced a sea of angry constituents at town hall events across the country. As the GOP dug in their heels to strip healthcare from millions of Americans, their own voting base began to realize that their own healthcare was threatened as well and that the law they referred to as Obamacare wasn t so bad after all.In fact, many realize that the law saved their lives and they don t want Republicans to repeal it and put their lives back in jeopardy.But Republicans shoved their bill through the House without even reading it and getting the CBO to score it. The bill lets states opt out of requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions, which have now been defined as including sexual assault, pregnancy, cancer, acne, asthma, diabetes, sleep apnea, Alzheimer s disease, and a whole host of other conditions and medical problems, a list of which you can find here.This pretty much would allow insurance companies to discriminate against millions of Americans, conservatives included.The bill also slashed $880 billion from Medicaid, which covers millions of low-income Americans, in order to fund a tax gift for the wealthy. Again, millions of Americans, including conservatives in red states, got healthcare because the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid.Understandably, most Americans are pissed at Republicans, especially after House Republicans celebrated taking healthcare from people by throwing a beer party on Capitol Hill and smiling and laughing about it at the White House Rose Garden while Donald Trump spiked the football.And Americans have been flocking to town halls ever since to shame Republicans for their actions. Many Republicans have even been too cowardly to even attend their own town halls to face the music.Those who have shown up have only angered their constituents even more by lying about what s in the bill and making any lame excuse they can think of to justify stripping healthcare from millions.That s why a conservative consulting firm in now telling Republicans to stop talking about repealing the Affordable Care Act.According to Raw Story,In a memo issued this week by conservative firm WPA Intelligence, lawmakers were cautioned to avoid using the term  full repeal  because it is highly unpopular.So, it appears that Republicans may now go to their constituents and claim that their bill is only a partial repeal even though it is, in fact, a full repeal.Make no mistake, this consulting firm knows that Republicans are committing political suicide. That s why they warned them to stop talking so much about the healthcare repeal.But the damage has already been done and will get even worse if Republicans send the bill to Trump for his signature.The American people, including conservative voters, now know that Republicans were full of shit when they insisted that a full repeal was the only way to fix the Affordable Care Act. The fact is that these problems can be easily fixed if Republicans are willing to work with Democrats. Instead of admitting they were wrong, Republicans doubled down and now they get to experience the consequences in 2018 when a Democratic wave could very well sweep them out of power in Congress.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2017"
 PREDICTION: White House Lies Will Force Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein To Quit,"The first reason the White House gave for President Donald Trump s firing of former FBI Director James Comey was that the president had received a recommendation from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. This excuse was bolstered by the memo Rosentein had given that was critical of Comey, though it did not explicitly call for the president to fire Comey.For his part, Rosenstein was not happy that the actions Trump took around Comey were blamed on that memo. Rosenstein has already demanded the White House correct the record about this. As a consequence, Trump himself told Lester Holt that the decision to fire Comey was all his. By all accounts, Rosenstein is a man of integrity. According to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Rosenstein left the impression that he couldn t work in an environment where facts weren t accurately reported  The deputy attorney general objected to statements by White House aides citing Mr. Rosenstein s critical assessment of Mr.Comey s job performance to justify the firing. If that is true, there is no way Rosenstein is going to have a long tenure in the Trump Department of Justice. Not only does this administration have a hard time telling the truth, they have hard time knowing what the truth is. This week alone, they claimed Rosenstein convinced the president that Comey should be fired, that Trump wanted Comey gone because of how badly he treated Hillary Clinton and that Comey told Trump that he wasn t under investigation. The only one of these three statements that even has a chance of being credible is the first, and it has been shot down.This all comes after months and months of lies and misstatements. The New York Times put together a list of all of the Tweets Trump has put out since he entered the White House. The number of lies that he has told just through that medium is staggering.Rosenstein has a serious decision to make. How seriously does he want to be taken? How much of his reputation is he willing to sacrifice? The chances seem good that he will have to bring on a special prosecutor to look into the Russia/Trump campaign link. That is one way to salvage his reputation. That may lead to his firing. Whether he quits or is fired, his days in this administration are numbered.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,"May 12, 2017"
 Fox News: Trump Is The One To Blame for White House ‘Disarray’ (VIDEO),"President Donald Trump likes to call most of the press  fake  so when the White House is called disorganized or unprofessional, it is easy for him to discount the criticism. FOX News, however, is one of his favorite outlets.This week it is hard to call the White House anything but a hot mess. The communications office, for instance, does not seem to have any idea of what s going on. But even Chris Wallace, the host of FOX News Sunday, is saying any problems in the White House communications office should be laid at the feet of the president.Wallace said,  One of the problems has been the disarray at the White House communications shop. The president has been blaming that on them, but the fact is it should be blamed on him, because he didn t seem to trust them enough to give them advanced notice. There have been reports that despite not having given his staff the information they needed to develop a coherent and comprehensive strategy, Trump was up watching the television coverage of Comey s firing, yelling at the set and blaming the people around him for not defending the decision.,Wallace said that he has been trying to book a White House spokesperson all week to go on his Sunday show and has had no success. He said,  They still haven t given us anybody. We can t even reach anybody   they re not available, they re not answering the phone. Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images.",News,"May 12, 2017"
 Trump Didn’t Have The Backbone To Fire James Comey Himself; Here’s The Former Bodyguard He Chose To Do It For Him,"President Donald Trump may be known for his catchphrase of  You re fired!  on the reality-TV series The Apprentice, but they don t seem to be the type of words he likes to utter in every day life. That s one of several reasons why Trump left it to his former bodyguard, Keith Schiller, to deliver the news to newly-ousted FBI Directer James Comey. So who is Keith Schiller?Schiller, one of the president s most trusted aides, has taken a step up in the world since Trump s election victory, earning himself the title of Director of Oval Office Operations after almost two decades of watching Trump s back. According to Corey Lewandowski, Trump s former campaign manager,  The president has exceptional confidence in Keith. If he asks him to do something, he knows it will get done. Schiller first encountered the Trump clan when he was working as a New York City police detective and spotted Marla Maples, Trump s second wife, in the Manhattan prosecutor s office back in 1999; Schiller was there for a meeting with Maples, who was reporting a theft by an employee. Not long after he sat down, a man pulled up a seat and introduced himself to Schiller as Trump s current bodyguard. I looked at him, totally not impressed by his stature, physical stature,  Schiller recalled in 2015 in a rare videotaped interview.  A light goes off. I said:  Bodyguard, I can do this  . . . I m no stranger to putting my hands on people. His mind was made up and Schiller reached out to Trump, landing a part-time position as a bodyguard. After retiring from the police department in 2004, Schiller began working for Trump full-time, now as the Trump Organization s director of security, a role which involved following Trump on the road during his campaign trail from that point, even providing an extra layer of security after the Secret Service took over.Schiller rarely gives interviews, but that hasn t stopped those around him from doing so and Michael Caputo, a political adviser who worked with Trump between 2013 and 2016, probably summed up best what Schiller means to the Trump organization.  Keith Schiller is not just some bodyguard,  says Caputo.  Nobody knows the score among the advisers better than Keith Schiller.  . . . Keith s always known what s what among the people who are in Donald Trump s orbit. Never was that level of trust on clearer display than in April when Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, traveled to Iraq. Despite the fact that Iraq specialist that would usually be present didn t participate after being told there was no room for them on the plane, Schiller was given a seat at the table during talks with members of the Iraqi government and appeared in official group photographs during the trip.Before becoming a member of Trump s elite inner circle, Schiller was renowned among his NYPD colleagues for his size and strength.  He was strong as an ox,  said David Chong, who served as Schiller s boss for eight years on a New York City police task force on high-intensity drug-trafficking areas. In fact, on some raids, Chong claims that Schiller would volunteer to carry the 60-pound battering ram, anticipating breaking in the door when he reached the top of the stairs.Schiller was also Trump s right-hand man during a WWE event, stepping briefly into the spotlight after Trump  slapped  World Wrestling Entertainment chief Vince McMahon in the center of the ring. As part of the bit, McMahon charged Trump, only to be stopped and repeatedly pushed back by Schiller before finally getting thrown to the ground by Donald Trump s head goon.Naturally, anyone associated with the Trump organization isn t going to be without their controversies and Keith Schiller has more than his fair share. For example, in September 2015 during Trump s campaign, Schiller took a sign from a protester. Unexpectedly, the protester, Efrain Galicia, lunged at Schiller but only received a punch in the face for his efforts, however, Galicia and other protesters are currently attempting to sue. During his testimony, Schiller acknowledged that at the time of the incident, he did not hold a valid New York state security guard license. On another occasion several days earlier, Schiller forcefully removed Univision anchor Jorge Ramos from a Trump campaign news conference for repeatedly asking questions about immigration.All things considered, it comes as no surprise that Donald Trump didn t fire the towering James Comey himself on Tuesday, opting for Keith Schiller over even a more junior staffer. Why would he when he has this type of hired muscle sitting at a desk a few feet away?Featured image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2017"
 Lawyers Trump Used To ‘Prove’ He Has No Russia Connection Won ‘Russia Law Firm Of The Year’ In 2016,"It was the tweet that blew up the internet:BREAKING: Trump lawyer: Tax returns from past 10 years show no ""income of any type from Russian sources,"" with few exceptions.  The Associated Press (@AP) May 12, 2017The headscratching claim by Trump s lawyers was that he had  no income of any type  from Russia  with few exceptions.The exceptions cited don t raise many eyebrows. What is noticeably absent is any mention of the Russia megadonors Eric Trump recently bragged helped finance Trump s golf resort, leading one to assume that there are things being intentionally left out of this report. (Eric Trump now denies making this admission, unfortunately Eric has been known to lie before.)The follow up story published by the Associated Press was even more bizarre (emphasis added).President Donald Trump s lawyers say a review of his last 10 years of tax returns do not reflect  any income of any type from Russian sources,  with some exceptions.The lawyers did not release copies of Trump s tax returns so The Associated Press cannot independently verify their conclusions.So Trump s lawyers  reviewed  Trump s tax returns and   surprise   found that he is completely innocent of any wrongdoing. But they won t let reporters independently verify those findings. So we just have to take their word for it If that s the case, then the law firm doing the investigation better have an absolutely impeccable record. Instead, Trump got one that has even more connections than he (allegedly!) does.The lawyers Trump turned to work for a firm called Morgan Lewis. It does a lot of business in Russia. It does so much business in Russia, in fact, that it actually nabbed a prestigious award for being  Russia Law Firm of the Year  in 2016.The law firm that sent the letter RE: Trump's biz interests in Russia was recognized as ""Russia Law Firm of the Year"" in 2016: pic.twitter.com/t7yBFpl1Hn  Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) May 12, 2017Others argue the law firm is merely a victim of its own success. It s a global company, of course it would be in Russia.Trump letter is dumb for other reasons, but not this. Morgan Lewis & Bockius is one of the biggest & most well-known lawfirms in the world. https://t.co/gBeg7Ms0EP  Jeff B/DDHQ (@EsotericCD) May 12, 2017However, this needn t be a massive conspiracy. Something worth thinking about: This group   which has a vested interest in not upsetting Trump and Putin   wants us to take their word at facevalue when they say that Trump is completely innocent. The very fact that they have business relationships and clients in Russia means they would feel pressured to tread lightly. Russia, a country run not only by Putin but a collective of oligarchs, can destroy your business if they feel antagonized by what you re doing.Making matters even more shady, Trump s lawyers claim they just released these findings at the behest of a congressional request. But the letter they sent is two months old. If it were that old, it may explain why Trump s lawyers didn t bother to mention Trump s Russian golf course investors. They didn t think it would come out. News of that relationship only leaked in the past few weeks.But there s an easy way to clear all this up: Trump could always release his tax returns to the public.Featured image via AFP-OUT",News,"May 12, 2017"
 Congress Demands White House Turn Over Alleged Comey Tape Mentioned In Trump’s Tweet (LETTER),"During yet another Twitter fit on Friday morning, Donald Trump seems to be unraveling before our eyes under the pressure of the press and ongoing investigations into his campaign ties to Russia.Earlier in the week, Trump fired James Comey who was the Director of the FBI. Now, in an effort to seemingly almost blackmail Comey so he doesn t leak any pertinent information regarding investigations, Trump tweeted:James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017Well, members of Congress saw this tweet and are holding him accountable for what is being implied. Quite honestly, it s about time Congress starts taking Trump s tweets seriously.Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) had this to say: Earlier this morning, President Trump wrote a tweet referencing his taping of high-level conversations in the White House. In light of this revelation, I would respectfully request that the White House Counsel provide the House Oversight Committee with all tapes of the President s communications with former FBI Director James Comey, of President Trump s meeting with Russian officials which was closed to American press but not their Russian counterparts, and of any conversations regarding the hiring or firing of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. These White House tapes could accelerate current investigations as previous tapes have aided past inquiries. Here is the official letter to White House Counsel Donald McGhan with the request:via krishnamoorthi.house.govIf Trump is going to use his Twitter account to relay information not only to the public but to the legislative branch of government, he better be prepared to face the consequences of his words.If there are tapes, this isn t only damning for Comey, but also Trump himself. He seems to think he can manipulate this whole situation like some sort of deal in a boardroom. This isn t a boardroom. This is the United States government, and good on Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi for calling him out.Featured Photo by Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2017"
" Trump’s Lawyer Says Trump Has No Russian Income ‘With A Few Exceptions’, Internet Drags Him (TWEETS)","Despite promising to release his tax returns all throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump still refuses to make good on his promise to concerned Americans. Instead, he s gotten his lawyers to make a statement about the last ten years of his tax returns, and it went pretty much exactly how we thought it would   it was a disaster.Raising more questions than they actually answered, Trump s lawyers told reporters that Trump s tax returns don t reflect any income of any type from Russian sources,  however there are  a few exceptions. According to the Associated Press, Trump s lawyers sent a letter stating that the dishonest, shady POTUS didn t owe any money to Russian lenders and had no equity investment by Russians in entities controlled by Trump.  Of course, these lawyers didn t provide any copies of the tax returns to verify this, so it s very possible that this information is false. However, the letter did state that Trump received  income from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant held in Moscow and a property sold to a Russian billionaire in 2008 for $95 million. Anyone with a decent brain can see how shady and weird this whole situation is, and it wasn t long before Twitter latched on to the statement  with a few exceptions  and made the hashtag  #WithFewExceptions  go viral. People didn t hesitate to drag Trump and his lawyers for their disgraceful scheme to clear his name, even though they ve clearly stated that he s guilty as hell.Here are some of the best reactions:       We could not have said it better. The lengths that Trump and his team have gone to continue hiding what is in his tax returns should be cause for alarm. Not to mention, Trump s erratic behavior whenever Russia is mentioned. Something shady is definitely going on, and no one should believe anything that comes out of the mouth of Trump, his administration, or anyone he hires.Featured image via Mario Tama / Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2017"

It only helps me, people like him. The guy was dying. By the way they were going to take him off television, then he started attacking me and he started doing better,  Trump said.  But his show was dying. I ve done his show.   But when I did his show, which by the way was very highly rated. It was high highest rating. The highest rating he s ever had.

The fact that most of America wants Trump to get kicked out of the White House is not a secret. With his historically low approval ratings (which dwindle by the day) as well as steadily mounting failures, it s hard to ignore that Trump s presidency is failing. There s just one big problem   Trump doesn t seem to know it, or at least he s not acknowledging it.Months later, Trump is still talking about his election victory. It s honestly an embarrassing win, considering he lost the popular vote by 3 million and scraped by thanks to the Electoral College. Combined with his pathetic inaugural crowds, no one understands why Trump still wants to brag about this, but he was back at it again in an interview with NBC News  Lester Holt last night. And during that interview, he said something that is going to blow your mind.Ignoring all facts and data that proves Trump is the least popular, least successful starting POTUS in modern history, Trump actually said that his election victory would be even greater if the election were held today   even after all his epic fails.Holt asked Trump if he felt like he was constantly fighting for legitimacy, and Trump said the country was  divided . He should have left it at that, but instead the lies started to pour freely. Trump said the GOP was very, very much behind  him and loved his disastrous health care plan   which many Republicans have publicly denounced. Trump then said  Obamacare is dead  before dropping the final bombshell.

" FBI Tells Trump To Go F*ck Himself For Firing Their Director, Forces Him To Cancel Visit","Donald Trump was hoping to visit the FBI for a photo-op in the wake of firing FBI Director James Comey. The FBI told Trump to f*ck off.In the days since Comey s firing, it has been revealed that Trump pulled the trigger in retaliation against the FBI investigation into his Russia scandal. Trump demanded that Comey be loyal to him and Comey refused to put Trump above the security of the country. Trump has even admitted that the Russia investigation was in his mind when he fired Comey.This contradicted the official White House statement on Comey s firing, which has sparked national outrage as most Americans disapprove of Trump s action.Trump was hoping for applause. Instead, he made things worse for himself. Now it s clear that he has something to hide.But he didn t just anger the American people. He pissed off the FBI, most of whom loved their former boss.So when Donald Trump wanted to visit the FBI on Thursday, they told him not to bother. Trump then tucked his tail between his legs and had the White House cancel the visit. He likely then threw a temper tantrum like a toddler. The FBI told the White House the optics would not be good,  NBC s Peter Alexander reported as the news came in.  FBI officials apparently said the president was unlikely to be greeted warmly after having just unceremoniously fired a very popular director. Alexander further explained that while many FBI agents voted for Trump, they don t like that he fired Comey and are disgusted by how Trump did it.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump just turned the FBI into his enemy, and that means they are going to work double-time on the investigation into his ties with Russia. And I m sure they will be all too happy to slap cuffs on Trump and haul his sorry ass to jail when the time comes.Featured image Shawn Thew   Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2017"

This, after he just fired the man who was investigating him.Supposedly, Trump is upset because fired FBI Director James Comey s associates disputed Trump s account of what happened during a dinner meeting between the two. According to the New York Times, Trump asked for Comey s loyalty, and Comey refused to give it.

 BREAKING: FBI Agents Say White House Will Kill Russian Investigation,"Agents within the FBI are worried that President Donald Trump may succeed in killing the probe into his campaign s ties to Russia. The Daily Beast is reporting on what has happened at the FBI since James Comey was fired on Tuesday. They say that agents who are working on the investigation fear they will be transferred to other departments and that their work will be discontinued. Comey, they say, was much more important to the investigation than many, who are outside of the agency, understand. While he may not not have actively been conducting the investigation, his active support helped it continue.A former lawyer in the Department of Justice s National Security Department, Carrie Cordero, said, He gave the agents, the investigators, cover politically. He said,  You go where the facts take you and I will handle the politics of it, I ll go brief the Hill, I ll hold off the White House.  He s the lineman in football, keeping everybody away from the guys that are trying to run or make the pass. He provided a cover for them to do what they needed to get done. One FBI source said, Management in counterintelligence are insanely concerned, worried about the overreaching obstruction and political influence from the White House.  What could the White House do to stop the investigation? One former FBI official says, They could slow down the investigations to a crawl, prevent charges from moving forward to DOJ for prosecution, or any other number of ways the White House could subvert these investigations,  said a former FBI official who worked on Russian investigations.A former FBI official, who was in the counterintelligence department, said,  You have to remember, these agents have families they need to support. The threat of being fired for doing their job is real here. And what about the testimony Andrew McCabe gave before the Senate that the investigation would continue?  One Congressional staffer said,  Literally who cares, nothing he said matters. He ll be gone. Of course, gumming up the works and intimidating FBI agents are not the only two things the White House can do to thwart an active FBI investigation. They can make sure it hits a wall when it gets to the prosecutorial stage at the Department of Justice. Whereas the FBI is made up of career law enforcement personnel, the Department of Justice is headed by a number of political appointeesFormer assistant director of the bureau s Criminal Investigation Division, Ron Hosko said,  There are often frustrations in sensitive, important investigations that you end up with prosecutors either too few, who are unwilling to move forward at the desired pace, or too many and you turn every simple decision into a debate club and it slows progress. Here, I think that is the pulse that you in the media and others ought to be keeping close to: What s the pace. Are the investigators getting the prosecutors  support that they need? Hosko added, Prosecutors will sometimes start to debate and question every word in a subpoena and it tends to slow progress. And then you start to ask questions about is this because of something political? Hosko concluded with, The Orange blob in the WH doesn t care about anyone or anything he can t control. He s made that abundantly clear. All of this means that it is critically important to appoint a special prosecutor to look into this. It is more than clear that the Trump Department of Justice cannot be trusted to handle this investigation. Featured image via Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2017"
 WTF? Trump Demanded Comey’s ‘Loyalty’ At Private Dinner,"President Donald Trump told his account of a private dinner he had with James Comey to Lester Holt but now it appears a lot more happened that he didn t mention and a lot of what he said went on, didn t.According to Trump, the dinner was set for Comey to ask to keep his job. On its face, this is farcical. The FBI Director is appointed for terms of ten years so Comey didn t have to ask Trump to stay on. Secondly, Trump claims he asked Comedy about any investigation into the president and that the answer was,  You are not under investigation.  That doesn t make any more sense.Comey s side of the story is a lot different. According to the New York Times,  As they ate, the president and Mr. Comey made small talk about the election and the crowd sizes at Mr. Trump s rallies. The president then turned the conversation to whether Mr. Comey would pledge his loyalty to him. When Comey refused to offer such a pledge, Trump persisted. While Comey did say he would be honest with Trump, the New York Times is reporting that,  Mr. Comey declined to make that pledge. Instead, Mr. Comey has recounted to others, he told Mr. Trump that he would always be honest with him, but that he was not  reliable  in the conventional political sense. Loyalty has always been super important to Trump throughout his life. As a businessman, it makes sense. You need to know that your proprietary information is going to stay private. When you are the leader of the United States (or any other country), this is not the same thing. It reeks of dictatorship.Of course, the White House is pushing back hard on the claims that the dinner in question was not the way Comey describes it. That is not surprising. The White House seems to come away from most events, from the Inauguration to pretty much everything that happens everywhere, with a different view than the rest of us.Perhaps the best way to look at this is how Former Congressman John Dingell Tweeted:It's a bit wild to see the Trump administration begin the same way Nixon's ended.I'd be laughing my ass off if I weren't so damn worried.

 North Korea Promises To “Mercilessly Wipe Out” Alleged U.S. Assassination Plotters,"North Korea is now vowing to  mercilessly wipe them out  while seeking extradition for those responsible for allegedly plotting to kill Kim Jong-un last week.The Vice Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol repeated the charge in a meeting on Thursday with foreign envoys in Pyongyang, that an attempted assassination on Kim Jong Un was carried out by the United States and South Korean intelligence agencies. Heinous terrorists were recently detected in the DPRK [Democratic People s Republic of Korea],  According to North Korean state news agency (KCNA),  The terrorists were infiltrated by the CIA of the U.S. and the puppet National Intelligence Service (NIS) of South Korea in a bid to commit state-sponsored terrorism against the supreme leadership of the KPRK by use of a biochemical substance. So far, North Korea s only individual suspect for the assassination attempt is a Pyongyang resident who allegedly was brainwashed and bribed by U.S. and South Korean agents to assassinate the leader. According to our law, the Central Public Prosecutor s Office of the KPRK will use all available methods to start to work to demand the handover of the criminals involved, so as to punish the organizers, conspirators, and followers of the terrible state-sponsored terrorism,  Said Han.Han then reportedly  declared the principle stand of the DPRK government to find out all of the terrorist maniacs and mercilessly wipe them out. Furthering his warning, Han stated that  Korean-style war on terrorism will be commenced at once in a consecutive and intensive way to root out the plot-breeding centers and dens of evil on this planet, including the CIA and the NIS. Interestingly enough, these threats come days after the newly elected South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, called for economic cooperation and increased dialogue with North Korea.This rhetoric couldn t come at a worse time, considering the increased tensions between the United States and North Korea over its nuclear ambitions and missile tests.Photo by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2017"

But on Thursday, he did something that was both unexpected and yet arguably necessary at this point: He pleaded with foreign intelligence agencies from around the world to help save the citizens of the U.S. from this  coup  by releasing any damning information they may have on the Trump administration.Olbermann begged these intel agencies, from all across the globe, to make the information they are rumored to have available to the American public. He urged them not to wait, to act now. Give the information to a reporter, leak it, put it on the internet, leave it outside someone s back door, he pleaded in desperation.Trump has fired the man investigating him, crippling our own intelligence agencies in the process, Olbermann continued. American citizens have lost their democracy as a result of this coup, and Republicans, the very people who have the power to stop him today, are choosing to do nothing. In a last ditch effort to save the U.S. from Trump, Olbermann has turned to the only people left that can help us: the intelligence agencies of other countries.Whether or not Olbermann s call to action will move someone to release damaging information remains to be seen.

 FBI Agents Are Doing Something Unusual In The Wake Of Comey’s Firing,"Prior to the Nov. 8 election, the FBI was, more or less, Trumpland. They wanted Trump to win. They neither trusted nor approved of Hillary Clinton. And that anti-Hillary attitude led to a number of anti-Hillary leaks to the press from the agency. They were angry with James Comey s decision not to indict Hillary over her emails.Now, though, the FBI is wracked with shock, anger and grief over Comey s sudden firing. According to the Daily Beast, one agent said his abrupt dismissal was like a death in the family. Another said that they re basically  sitting shiva,  which is a Jewish ritual of mourning just after a funeral.And some of them are doing something very unusual for a situation like this: They re posting pictures of themselves with Comey on social media, and even changing their profile pics to those of Comey. That s a gesture generally reserved for someone who dies.Acting Director Andrew McCabe told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Comey was well-liked and had broad support throughout the bureau. In other words, when Trump said that Comey had lost the trust and respect of his rank and file, he was either not speaking for the majority of the rank and file, or he was flat-out lying.Rank-and-file agents were also very suspicious of the timing of Comey s firing, wondering whether it had anything to do with the Russia probes. Various officials  phones were ringing off the hook. FBI headquarters in D.C. was more or less locked down and not answering the flood of phone calls coming in.One agent told the Daily Beast that there s likely to be serious distrust of whoever Trump puts into Comey s place: No matter who gets the job, there will be a cloud of suspicion because the President is unpopular with much of the [U.S.]. That bad faith will make it harder to do my job. Trump undermined the public s trust in the FBI more than Comey ever could. The new director is going to face a tough confirmation, with much of the Senate viewing Trump with suspicion, too.

 Tim Kaine Can’t Hold Back His Tears During Heart Wrenching Health Care Hearing,"On Wednesday, Senate Democrats held a shadow hearing  to hear what the American people have to say about the GOP health care bill. It was an emotional scene, with story after story about how much harm the American Health Care Act will cause. After listening to one particularly heartbreaking story, Sen. Tim Kaine was so moved that he was unable to hold back his tears.I remember standing at the mailbox with my tiny baby   she was still under 10 pounds at 11 months old   cradled in my arms, and opening an envelope from the children s hospital with a bill inside for $64,000, more than my husband s annual salary, for merely  renting  the surgical room and equipment used during her heart surgery the month before, said Cyndi Johnson, a math teacher from Bloomington, Indiana.Johnson continued, explaining that before the Affordable Care Act became the law of the land, the medical costs she found herself paying out of pocket for her baby were spiraling with no end in sight.  In order to provide around the clock care for her daughter, Johnson had to quit her job. But Obamacare changed all that. She explained that if the ACA hadn t removed the lifetime cap, her daughter would have reached it before her fifth birthday.As a parent, absolutely nothing else matters when your child is sick,  Johnson said.  Your world shrinks and everything else just falls away. I would have sold my house, my car, done literally anything to keep my daughter healthy   and no family should have to make that horrible choice. All the senators had the hearing were moved by Johnson s testimony, but Tim Kaine choke back his tears.Mrs. Johnson, tears just started rolling down my face,  Kaine said.  The people who passed this law couldn t care less what any of you think or what any of your experiences are. Just think, instead of Mike Pence, who can t wait to snatch health care away from sick babies, we could have had Tim Kaine as our vice president. But, her emails.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2017"
 GOPer Who Resurrected Trumpcare Just Got WRECKED By A Father At Town Hall (VIDEO),"Hey, you remember the GOPer who is responsible for the amendment to Trumpcare that allows states to obtain waivers to the provision that requires insurers to charge customers the same regardless of pre-existing conditions? Well, in case you don t, his name is Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, and he s not very popular back home right now.The former health insurance executive was one of only two Republicans from his state to back Trump s signature deathcare legislation, even writing the amendment that allows insurers to bilk people with preexisting conditions out of more of their money than they will already be throwing at their increased premiums under the Republican plan.On Wednesday, MacArthur s constituents gathered to tear him a new orifice.MacArthur asked about pre-existing protection changes. Audience: ""If you have a pre-existing condition, stand up."" Most audience on feet. pic.twitter.com/V4lhgGVX7q  Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) May 10, 2017One attendee in particular stood out when he gave an emotional explanation of why MacArthur and all who think like him are absolutely awful.Geoff Ginter is a certified medical assistant and both of his kids have pre-existing conditions. He also, for some reason, gets very angry when someone tries to kill his children:My wife was diagnosed with cancer when she was 40 years old. She beat it, but every day   every day   she lives with it. She thinks about it. Every pain, every new something going on somewhere, is it coming back? Is this cancer? Do I have it again? Is it gonna kill me this time? Is it gonna take me away from my children? Speaking of which: my children. Both have pre-existing conditions from birth. One cardiac, one thyroid. You have been the single greatest threat to my family in the entire world. You are the reason I stay up at night. You are the reason that I cannot sleep. What happens if I lose my job?He s right. As of now, not just MacArthur but the entire GOP from top to bottom is the  single greatest threat  to all our families. They are the reasons we stay up at night   because they represent the worst that humanity has to offer.Watch  it below, and try to figure out how MacArthur sleeps at night.

 BREAKING: FBI Is Raiding GOP Election Consulting Firm,"While the Republican Party rants on and on about non-existent voter fraud, the evidence is mounting that they are the party that is engaged in electoral malfeasance and now, the FBI is raiding a firm that helped in Republican elections.The raid was on the Strategic Campaign Group. According to reports, about a half dozen FBI agents arrived Thursday morning to search and seize records.Details are scant now, and will be updated as the story develops, but here s what we have so far, and none of it has anything to do with Donald Trump:(Kelley) Rogers (President of Strategic Campaign Group), who said his firm represents the campaign committees for Maryland House and Senate candidates, told reporters that the FBI investigation concerns work the firm performed during the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial campaign of former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a Republican.According to Rogers, his firm settled a civil suit brought by the Cuccinelli campaign after he lost that race to Democrat Terry McAuliffe. Rogers said the investigation appears to have stemmed from allegations brought in that suit. Twitter, though, has their theories and none of them look good for Donald Trump.The Cuccinelli suit (which was settled for between $75,000 and $85,000) alleged that Strategic Campaign Group and the associated Conservative Strike Force Political Action Committee   an independent group not affiliated with the candidate   raised about $2.2 million by assuring donors it would spend the money to help elect the GOP candidate. The suit alleged that the PAC and Strategic Campaign Group failed to follow through on promises for an extensive media campaign on Cuccinelli s behalf.Source: Capital GazetteThis isn t to imply that just because they were busted once, that s their only crime. The timing perfectly coordinates with warrants and subpoenas being issued in the Trump/Russia investigation. According to the left wing blog The Palmer Report:One of the insiders whose sources correctly pointed to today s FBI action is Democratic insider Claude Taylor. In the wake of the Annapolis raid, he s now sharing the following:  Source in legal community reports large number of Warrants from Eastern District of Virginia being executed. By the FBI. Source reports frenzy of activity inside the EDVA, large number of agents, US Marshals. The battle has been joined  (link). He goes on to add more details about the goings-on at the Eastern District Court of Virginia, which Comey recently confirmed is working with the FBI on the Trump-Russia investigation. The basement of the EDVA was described as resembling a  judicial Armada  with a dozen or more FBI and US Marshals vans,  Taylor states.Regardless of whether this is about Trump or not, it s clear that the GOP has gotten cocky in their lawlessness and their chickens are coming home to roost.

 Trump Displays Incredible Ignorance Yet Again — Claims Credit For Term Coined Over A Hundred Years Ago,"Have you ever wondered where a phrase started? How about the phrase  prime the pump?  It is widely considered to mean the use of government money to get a project going. While it dates back to the 1800s, President Donald Trump is now claiming that he invented the phrase. In reality, the use of the phrase  prime the pump  predates Trump s own birth by a hundred years, and the use of it in the current economic sense has existed since the 1930s.In a recent conversation with The Economist, this exchange happened (they were talking about Trump s tax plan):The Economist: But beyond that it s OK if the tax plan increases the deficit? Trump: It is OK, because it won t increase it for long. You may have two years where you ll you understand the expression  prime the pump ? The Economist: Yes. Trump: We have to prime the pump. The Economist: It s very Keynesian. Trump: We re the highest-taxed nation in the world. Have you heard that expression before, for this particular type of an event? The Economist: Priming the pump? Trump: Yeah, have you heard it? The Economist: Yes. Trump: Have you heard that expression used before? Because I haven t heard it. I mean, I just I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It s what you have to do.According to The Free Dictionary:Prime the Pump: Encourage the growth or action of something, as in  Marjorie tried to prime the pump by offering some new issues for discussion.  In the late 1800s this expression originally was used for pouring liquid into a pump to expel the air and make it work. In the 1930s it was applied to government efforts to stimulate the economy and thereafter was applied to other undertakings.It is hardly surprising that a) Trump had never heard this phrase, as it is rarely used on Twitter and b) he would take credit for it. In a week with so many gaffes, lies and just strange behavior, this may not be as big an issue but it s clear how little this man knows and how little he understands the world and reality that the rest of us live in. Another explanation could be that Trump is much, much older than we have been led to believe and has gone completely senile.Featured image via Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.",News,"May 11, 2017"
 WATCH: ‘The View’ TRASHES Trump For Barring American Press From Covering Meeting With Russian Officials,"Donald Trump s decision to choose Russian state media over American journalists has drawn the ire of the ladies on  The View. On Wednesday, just one day after firing FBI Director James Comey as the agency continues to investigate his Russia scandal, Trump took a meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Kislyak is the Russian official whom Michael Flynn spoke to during the transition, an action that raised further concerns about Trump s ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin.And raised even more concerns by letting Russian state media attend the meeting complete with all of their equipment, while banning the free press in the United States from attending.The decision especially concerns former CIA deputy director David Cohen.After Vice-President Joe Biden s former national security adviser posed a  deadly serious  question about whether it was smart of Trump to allow Russian state media and their equipment in the Oval Office, Cohen replied.@ColinKahl No, it was not.  David S. Cohen (@cohendavid) May 10, 2017Kahl went to explain that he wasn t even allowed to bring his phone into the Oval Office, nor was he allowed to let foreign delegations bring cameras in that room. But Trump let Putin s propaganda machine do it.This infuriated Joy Behar so much that she ripped Trump a new one on Thursday, calling his actions  treasonous  and  un-American. He s speaking to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador Kislyak who s the one who Michael Flynn got fired for talking to,  Behar said.  And in the room, here s Trump talking to the Russians and the Russian press is there covering, and guess who s missing from the room? The American press. They were barred from the room. This is treason to me. This is un-American, it s unpatriotic. Americans should be furious. Here s the video via YouTube:Indeed, Americans should also be worried. Trump may have just compromised national security by letting Putin s propaganda network inside the Oval Office. The threat of listening devices and cameras being covertly placed inside the Oval Office is a very real threat. This is where the president often meets with foreign officials, staffers, members of Congress, and military leaders.Inviting a Russian state media crew into the Oval Office is irresponsible. Trump s refusal to let American media cover the meeting is flagrantly outrageous because Trump chose Putin s propaganda machine over the American free press. It s suspicious and makes one wonder what Trump wanted to hide from the American people.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"May 11, 2017"
" Russian Photographer In The Oval Office Raises Eyebrows, Security Problems","Former U.S. intelligence officials have criticized the presence of a Russian photographer capturing President Trump s meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in the Oval Office on Wednesday, citing the potential for a security breach. Concerns were raised after photographs of the meeting were posted on the TASS Russian News Agency website.The White House, however, is playing down the situation, with one senior administration official stating that the Russian had to go through the same screening as a member of the U.S. press going through the main gate to the [White House] briefing room.  Furthermore, the official claims that the White House was misled, claiming that Russian officials had stated that the individual in question was actually Lavrov s personal photographer, concealing the fact that he was also a TASS employee, clearing demonstrating their screening of the Russian photographer was not sufficient. We were not informed by the Russians that their official photographer was dual-hatted and would be releasing the photographs on the state news agency,  said the White House administration official.Former deputy CIA director David S. Cohen was one of several who expressed their concerns over the Russian photographer s presence. Cohen took to Twitter to respond to an online question as to whether or not he thought it was an intelligent decision to have the photographer present at the event, tweeting No it was not.  However, Cohen would not elaborate when pressed for further opinions.Other former security officials have made their unease over the whole situation public, with some describing it as a potential security threat, claiming that White House security screenings aren t foolproof and sophisticated espionage devices could be missed. Others have noted that, not only is it not below the Russians to plant a bug in the White House, but if they managed to pull off such a feat, it wouldn t be the first time they were successful. In late 1999, a listening device that was eventually traced back to Russia was found in a White House conference room where Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had been conducting meetings.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2017"
 Trump Incriminates Himself: I Decided To Fire Comey; Demanded He Give Me Details On My Investigation,"In what may go down in history as one of the greatest fatal mistakes any president has ever made, Trump decided to sit down with NBC s Lester Holt and spill the beans on his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey mid-way through the FBI s investigation into Trump s collusion with Russia. Even casual observers of the law know that when you stand accused of crimes, in this case going all the way up to possible treason, the best thing to do is shut up and get a lawyer. Instead Trump just gave an unhinged confession of sorts that will be broadcast worldwide.The clip that everyone will be talking about came when Holt turned to Trump s decision to fire Comey and the reasons behind it. A visibly angry Trump managed to debunk his own administration s lies about the circumstances behind the dismissal and instead incriminated himself.By White House versions, Trump decided to fire Comey after he was given that recommendation by the Deputy Attorney General and after realizing Comey had lost the respect of the American people and those working within the FBI. By Trump s telling, he had already made up his mind to fire Comey long before any recommendation passed his desk and even went further: I was going to fire Comey. My decision. It was not A stunned Holt interrupt him to clarify:  You had made decision before they had come into the room? Trump, not realizing he may as well have been confessing to a bank robbery, nonchalantly responds in the affirmative:  I was going to fire Comey. There s no good time to do it, by the way. That s huge, because Trump is admitting his personal grudge against Comey led directly to the FBI Director s dismissal. His hand wasn t forced. He just didn t like Comey or what he was looking into.But Trump, oblivious to all of this, marched on and stumbled into an even greater admission of guilt: He also claimed to have directly asked the FBI director for details about his investigation. That s a HUGE no-no. In one case I called him In one case he called me  I actually asked him. I said,  If it s possible, will you let me know am I under investigation?' According to Trump, Comey assured him he wasn t. (Comey, in fact, has testified under oath that Trump and his campaign are under investigation meaning Trump is lying or Comey is. Which is more likely?) But in either case, what Trump is confessing to is a major ethical and perhaps even legal violation. Demanding an FBI investigator provide you   the person he s investigating   with up-to-date details on how the case is proceeding presents all sorts of problems.BREAKING: I was going to fire Comey anyway, Pres. Trump tells @LesterHoltNBC in exclusive interview at White House https://t.co/MAmo1PE1RL  NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) May 11, 2017Ultimately, it may have been the fact that Comey wouldn t give Trump the details on his investigation that led to his dismissal. Sources close to Trump say the White House was furious when Comey refused to unethically hand over his planned remarks before his congressional hearing in the days before his firing.If this were a game of Clue, Trump just confessed to being in the billiard room with the candlestick.

" BREAKING: Acting FBI Director McCabe Contradicts White House, Says Russian Probe Will Continue","Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe testified today in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee. When asked if the rank and file employees of the law enforcement agency, he said,  Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the F.B.I. and still does to this day. The vast majority of F.B.I. employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey, McCabe went on to say,  It has been the greatest privilege and honor of my professional life to have worked with him. When asked about the current investigation into any ties between the Trump campaign, McCabe said that the agency considers this investigation to be very important and serious. As to what impact Comey s firing will have on the investigation, he said,  The work of the men and women of the FBI continues despite any changes in circumstances,  he said in response to a question from Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.  There has been no effort to impede our investigation to date. Simply put, you cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing. Given what the White House has said this week, both areas are important. Yesterday, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders told the press that the reason Comey was fired was because, among other things, that he had lost the confidence of the agents there. One reason many believe President Trump fired Comey, and no one believes anyone but Trump made this decision, because he thought it might slow down the investigation. It now appears neither of those ideas are true.Featured image via Alex Wong/ Getty Images.",News,"May 11, 2017"
" Dan Rather Blasts GOP For Protecting Trump, Gives Them A Tongue Lashing They’ll Never Forget (VIDEO)","Legendary journalist Dan Rather has become a major critic of Donald Trump and the GOP, and if there s anyone who should be commenting on the firing of FBI Director James Comey, it s him.On MSNBC s Hardball with Chris Matthews, Rather weighed in on Trump s shady behavior in firing Comey right as the Russia investigation was heating up. In his appearance, Rather said he wanted the Republican Party to take a good look at themselves and figure out why they refused to hold Trump accountable when it s blatantly obvious that this is a cover-up.In speaking with Matthews, Rather called Trump s termination of Comey a  smoke screen  and stated that the Russia scandal needs to be done by an independent commission with a special prosecutor, which many people are calling for. Rather said: [The Comey firing], it s smoke screen, it s cover. I ll be very surprised if it fools very many among the American people.   What s needed here are some Republican leaders. Republicans have the White House, they have the Supreme Court, they have the Congress. This is going to require some Republican officeholders with guts who say to themselves,  I want the Trump administration to succeed, I want my party to succeed, but more importantly, I want to do what s good for the country.  And they know, in that secret place behind their hearts that what s good for the country is an independent, bipartisan commission with a special prosecutor. Rather has always nailed it when it comes to analyzing Trump, and he did it again. It s obvious that Comey s firing was meant to be a distraction, and everyone seems to acknowledge this except for the GOP. The Republican Party s tendency to look the other way and protect their own is hurting the country and will have serious consequences if something is not done immediately.The best thing Republicans can do now is act like grown ups and forget about getting one over on the Democrats so that Trump s issues can be dealt with. America s democracy cannot be played with, and should not be compromised because the GOP refuses to work with others. If they cannot, an independent commission is America s only hope for Trump to be held accountable.You can watch Rather tear the GOP to shreds below:Dan Rather to Republicans: Show some guts and hold Trump accountable for this cover-up pic.twitter.com/lcbgSMldV5  Sean Colarossi (@SeanColarossi) May 10, 2017Featured image via Frederick M.

 Trump Spotted Hanging Up Easily The Most Pathetic Picture Of All Time In The White House (PHOTO),"By generous accounts Trump is facing a scandal as inflammatory as Watergate. By less than generous accounts, Trump is facing a scandal even more inflammatory than Watergate. So what is he doing to address it? Apparently, clamping his hands over his ears, squeezing his eyes closed tight and wishing it was November 9, 2016 again.In what may go down as one of the saddest moments in West Wing history, Trump s aides were spotted shuffling in a giant framed picture of you guessed it  the election map.

(They said no.)The framed picture which will now hang somewhere in the West Wing (along historic portraits of former presidents and paintings commissioned from world-famous painters) seems to be Trump s answer to the press for not doing his bidding: If you won t run the map in your newspapers, I ll just hang it up in the White House!Trump, angry, bitter, and increasingly beleaguered by self-created scandals, has retreated further and further into his ego-friendly safe space. The fact that his map   which reflects the election results by county   doesn t show what he thinks it shows only makes his desperation more pathetic. Trump see s a lot of red, literally explains to reporter that it represents  us,  and thinks it shows that people like him. Instead, the map s colors are misleading. Trump may have won a lot of counties   but the ones he won are mostly empty, and trees don t vote. The blue spots represent the biggest areas of human population in the country, including Trump s hometown of New York City, and they all voted against him. That s why he lost by three million votes.Featured image via Twitter",News,"May 11, 2017"

 Trump’s Approval Rating Took A HUGE Nosedive Right BEFORE He Fired Comey (DETAILS),"Trump just can t get anything off the ground for his failing presidency. Every time his approval numbers start to inch up, he does something else and the next poll shows his approval in the tank again. And sometimes, like now, it slips below its previous crater.According to a Quinnipiac poll conducted May 4-9, only 36 percent of registered approve of the job Trump is doing. That s down from 40 percent in mid-April, and is a near-record low for his presidency. On April 4, his approval was 35 percent.This poll was conducted before Trump fired James Comey from his position as FBI Director, so that controversy hasn t hit the polls yet. This nosedive is in response to other things Trump and the Republicans have done over the last several weeks. But even without that, 61 percent of voters think Trump is a goddamn liar (he is), and 66 percent believe he s not levelheaded (he isn t).Trump s biggest drop was among white voters without a college education. These people are the same who voted for him because they bought his song and dance about being able to bring an unprecedented level of prosperity back to them. Just 47 percent approve of his job now, compared to 57 percent last month.10 percent is a huge drop for less than four weeks, particularly from Trump s own base.Another interesting aspect of this poll is that a majority of Americans now want the Democrats to take control of Congress in 2018   that number stands at 54 percent, compared to just 38 percent that want Republicans to retain control. The biggest thing people seem to be unhappy with is the GOP s very unpopular plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Neither Trump nor Republicans seem to care that even their own constituents want them to fix the ACA rather than repeal it.On April 19, Trump s approval rating among independents was 38 percent, and that has likewise plummeted. It stands at just 29 percent now.Remember, none of this includes the clusterfuck surrounding James Comey s termination. It ll be interesting to see what happens going forward   that decision was extremely controversial, and Congressional Democrats, along with some Republicans, are unhappy and suspicious now.Featured image by Molly Riley-Pool via Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2017"

Trump, one high level GOP staff member is calling for the return of Congressional control to the Democrats. Mark Salter was the chief of staff to Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and served as a high level advisor to McCain s 2008 presidential campaign tweeted that he thinks U.S. national security may depend on giving Congress back to the Democrats.Words I thought I'd never say: the security of the United States might now depend on electing a Democratic Congress in 2018.

Only one other time in American history has the president fired the director of the FBI. Bill Clinton only fired William Sessions because Sessions had misused government funds for personal use.The White House explanation for the firing was that Comey had mishandled the investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails. What? The official story is that Comey lost his job because he was mean to Hillary? Does any one really think this explanation lives in the same zip code as plausibility?In a week this strange, it is hard to decide what the strangest part has been.Last night, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was caught in the bushes and would only do a briefing if the press kept their cameras off.Some Republicans have come out with questions about the reasons Comey was fired. The usual skeptical suspects, Senators McCain and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) have been joined by Senators Richard Burr (R-NC), Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Ben Sasse (R-NE).You have to wonder if any of the Republicans in Congress who are blindly following Trump even read the oath of office they all took not all that long ago.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"May 11, 2017"
 Deputy Attorney General PISSED; Trump Ordered Him To Find Reason To Fire Comey,"Just when you think you re starting to figure out what happened with James Comey getting fired from the FBI, another tidbit of information comes out and turns the whole thing on its head once again.In a new twist, Donald Trump knew that Comey reported directly to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. So, in an effort to move things along with Comey, he had them come to the White House.According to The Washington Post: The president already had decided to fire Comey, according to this person. But in the meeting, several White House officials said Trump gave Sessions and Rosenstein a directive: to explain in writing the case against Comey. And we all know what happened next. The memos were written by all parties and made public pretty fast. Faster than Comey could even become aware he was fired.Here s the thing, though. Deputy AG Rosenstein is pissed he s basically become the fall guy for Trump.WaPo reports: Rosenstein threatened to resign after the narrative emerging from the White House on Tuesday evening cast him as a prime mover of the decision to fire Comey and that the president acted only on his recommendation, said the person close to the White House, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. You see, the narrative came out that Comey went to the Justice Department only days before he was fired requesting  more prosecutors and other personnel to accelerate the bureau s investigation into Russia s interference in the presidential election.  And this request was made to Rosenstein,  whose memo was used to justify Mr. Comey s abrupt dismissal on Tuesday. Now that Rosenstein is pissed, it s looking more and more likely that Trump may have planned it this way and made Rosenstein the fall guy for Comey s removal.The plot in this story of mayhem is definitely getting thicker and it will be interesting to see how things progress in the coming weeks and months.Featured Photo by Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2017"
 BREAKING: Comey Was Troubled By Evidence Of ‘Collusion With Russia’ When Trump Fired Him,"It s interesting that Donald Trump, in his letter terminating FBI Director James Comey, noted that Mr. Comey had allegedly told the President* on three separate occasions that he is not being investigated for two reasons: the FBI admitted in a legal filing recently that they are, indeed, directly investigating Donald Trump s public plea for Russia to hack his opponents, and another little tidbit of information that surfaced in a Wall Street Journal report   Comey did indeed suspect collusion. In fact, there is evidence.While Trump, who has said that Comey did Hillary Clinton a huge favor in not charging her for crimes she did not commit, claims that the firing was because of how oh-so-terribly unfair the former Director was to his former opponent (the same one he asked Russia to hack), CNN reports that the firing was because Comey refused to provide Trump with an assurance of personal loyalty and because the investigation was  accelerating  (Comey had requested additional funds for the investigation just before he was terminated).The WSJ reports that at the time of his firing, contrary to Trump s assertion, Comey had become increasingly concerned to the point of requesting daily instead of weekly updates on the investigation:Mr. Comey started receiving daily instead of weekly updates on the investigation, beginning at least three weeks ago, according to people with knowledge of the matter and the progress of the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe. Mr. Comey was concerned by information showing possible evidence of collusion, according to these people.White House officials said Wednesday that Mr. Trump had for months been contemplating the possibility of removing Mr. Comey, and that the dismissal this week wasn t connected to the Russian probe.Comey had been asked by lawmakers to  accelerate  the investigation, according to the WSJ, and had briefed them on Monday on his plan to do so   yes, right before he was fired.Donald Trump is getting worried. Recently, he changed his Twitter header to a quote of one of his own tweets. That tweet was a lie claiming that James Clapper had confirmed that there was  no evidence  to support claims of collusion.The investigation is heating up. Subpoenas have been issued, and every animal   even especially stupid, especially orange ones   can sense its end.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"May 11, 2017"
 Bombshell Report Reveals What Comey REALLY Thought Of Trump,"By now, the whole world knows that the investigation into Donald Trump and his campaign s ties to Russia is likely what led to the firing of FBI Director James Comey. However, new reporting also reveals that Comey really didn t think much of Trump in the first place. According to a report in The Week, Comey had expressed concern about Trump s temperament as it related to the presidency and the leadership of the nation. He allegedly told confidantes that Trump is  crazy  and  outside the realm of normal. Like the rest of the sane people in America, Comey also seemed to believe that Trump s lack of self restraint and his impulsive and reckless statements on Twitter were a danger to the nation. Further, it seems that Trump was angry with Comey on several occasions as well. When Comey testified in open Congressional hearing that there was no evidence to corroborate Trump s claim that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, Trump was incensed. The same is true of Comey s refusal to pledge loyalty to Trump instead of the United States Constitution.Daniel C. Richman, a close adviser to Comey, says of the situation: With a president who seems to prize personal loyalty above all else and a director with absolute commitment to the Constitution and pursuing investigations wherever the evidence led, a collision was bound to happen. Indeed. And that is the problem: Trump doesn t give a damn about the Constitution or the rule of law; in fact, he seems to only care for himself and what benefits him and makes him look good. He doesn t care about the American people, or the nation. This whole sorry excuse for a  presidency  is nothing more than the ultimate reality show for an incompetent, unfit fool with the biggest ego in the world. Unfortunately, we re all paying the price.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2017"
 Comey Sources Are Speaking Out; He Was Fired For Two Reasons And They Are Both Frightening (VIDEO),"Days after testifying in front of Congress and after requesting more resources for the Russian investigation, FBI Director James Comey was fired on Tuesday night, effective immediately.The Trump administration is blaming Comey s handling of the Hillary Clinton emails, which makes no sense whatsoever because Trump loved Comey s handling of the emails in October. Trump tried to make the case that he fired Comey for being mean to Hillary Clinton, but even the most rabid Trump supporters have to acknowledge that his  Lock Her Up,  slogan is completely incompatible with Trump s given rationale.It doesn t take a tin foil conspiracy theorist to imagine that the real reason for the Comey firing is that he was getting too close to the truth in investigating Trump s Russia connections. NPR imagines even more scenarios, like the fact that Comey was becoming too big and was stepping on poor little Donnie s ego. It s becoming more and more likely though, that there were just two reasons Comey was fired and both of them should scare the hell out of you.According to two sources that CNN is calling  close to Comey,  the two reasons Comey was fired were:#2 confirms everything we ve been assuming since the news broke Tuesday night. #1, though, while not at all surprising, is almost more frightening. Trump had to have approached Comey at some point, demanding his loyalty. That s third-rate Banana Republic dictator crap. It makes one wonder just how many people have had to make an oath of loyalty, not to the Constitution, but to Trump. Maybe it s just the people who might have damaging goods on the administration or maybe it s every single person in his administration, which could explain why hundreds of jobs still remain unfilled within the Executive Branch.Loyalty oaths or no loyalty oaths, the Trump administration s charade when it comes to the handling is quickly coming unraveled. It likely won t be long before Comey, and not just sources close to him, are speaking out   and perhaps speaking to Congress.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2017"
 Top Dems Take Action To Keep Documents On Russia Investigation Safe From Trump,"Democrats are taking action to keep Donald Trump away from documents related to the investigation of his possible collusion with Russia to steal the presidential election. Following the firing of FBI Director James Comey, top ranking members of the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the Justice Department urging the FBI to retain all Russia investigation documents and not share them with the Trump administration. It was brazen, one of the most staggering, stunning acts of a president compromising an investigation,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, said.Trump s decision to fire Comey (the person who just happened to be investigating him) is being compared to Richard Nixon s Saturday Night Massacre and Democrats have called his actions  Nixonian,   mind-boggling  and  a cover-up. If there was any question about the need for a special prosecutor, there is none now,  Blumenthal said. They fired Sally Yates. They fired Preet Bharara. And now they fired Director Comey, the very man leading the investigation. This does not seem to be a coincidence, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. Comey was scheduled to testify on Thursday but what will happen now that he is no longer heading up the FBI remains to be seen. I doubt if he ll attend on Thursday but it is still my strong desire to have now-former director Comey to come and testify before the committee,  Sen. Mark Warner said.Comey has indeed been invited to testify as a private citizen, although he has not yet accepted the offer. If he were to do so, and it was a closed-door hearing, he would be free to provide much more information now that he is not the director of the FBI. And this could prove disastrous for Trump.Hopefully, the FBI and the DOJ do as the Democrats are asking and keep these vital documents pertaining to the Russia investigation safe from not only the White House but Attorney General Jeff Sessions as well. Trump and his crooked cronies certainly aren t afraid of trying to make the evidence of their collusion disappear. They are in so deep that they will stop at nothing to escape the inevitable consequences that are coming.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2017"
 Betsy DeVos TOTALLY HUMILIATED During Keynote Speech At Historically Black University,"U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos tried to give a speech at the graduation ceremony of a historically black university, and things did not go well for her.When DeVos began to speak at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, the students loudly booed her and turned their backs.  I am honored to become a Wildcat,  DeVos started out, waving her honorary doctorate in the air proudly. And then the boos started and they did not stop. If this behavior continues your degrees will be mailed to you,  insisted Edison Jackson, the school s president.  Choose which way you want to go.  Unfortunately for DeVos, that didn t shut them up. Jackson was also booed when he tried mentioned White House communications official Omarosa Manigault.  You don t know her, nor do you know her story,  Jackson whined, which only prompted the crowd to boo more.The decision to have DeVos give the keynote address at the graduation ceremony has been a source of contention since the announcement was made. On Tuesday, protesters presented the school with petitions and called on leaders to cancel her speech. The petition had garnered 50,000 signatures. According to their complaints, not only has DeVos failed to support student loan borrowers, but she is also fundamentally ignorant about HBCUs.She proved this last part herself in February when she said that HBCUs were  real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They saw that the system wasn t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution,  she said in a statement after meeting with school leaders.As a result of these obviously problematic remarks, DeVos has been accused  whitewashing  the history of these historically black institutions. In an attempt to save face, she later said that these schools arose  out of necessity, in the face of racism.  But that doesn t seem to have been enough to appease the students who just booed her.Jasmine Johnson, one of the graduating students who was not even a little impressed with DeVos  presence, explained why she was so upset.  For someone to come and speak at my commencement that cannot relate to me or know what I have been through is kind of like a slap in the face,  she said.According to the petition against DeVos  visit, asking her to speak at the commencement ceremony was an  insult  to the school s legacy. In addition, the NAACP Florida State Conference is calling for Jackson s resignation.You can watch DeVos get humiliated here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 10, 2017"

" Trump Meets With Russian Officials One Day After Firing Comey, Bars American Media From The Room","Donald Trump just met with the Russian ambassador who is at the center of his scandal and made sure no American reporters were there to cover their conversation.If Trump offered the Russians anything in return for helping him win the election, Wednesday s meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak was the prime opportunity to give them their reward.Kislyak, as you may recall, is the Russian official who spoke with Michael Flynn during the transition. Kislyak also met with Jeff Sessions, who did not disclose the meeting during his confirmation hearing prior to being confirmed as Attorney General. Sessions has since recused himself from the Russia investigation.Kislyak is the central Russian figure involved in Trump s Russia scandal, yet Trump gladly met with him in private on Wednesday, the day after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey as the FBI continues to investigate Trump s collusion with Russia. But Trump went a step further by barring American media from covering the meeting, preferring to give Russian state media (also known as Vladimir Putin s propaganda machine) access instead.The Russian Embassy posted a photo of the meeting on Twitter.Ambassador Kislyak and President Trump /    .       .  pic.twitter.com/Ckkx2YL9KX  Russia in USA ??

Meanwhile, Russian state media was allowed to be there and take what amounts to propaganda photos. And we all know that Russian state media won t give us an accurate account of what Trump and Kislyak talked about.They could have talked about the Russia scandal and investigation and no one will ever know about.Trump s disdain for the free press has just reached a new low, and Twitter ripped his throat out for it.@RusEmbUSA pic.twitter.com/m1sECOygBE  Jaime Primak (@JaimePrimak) May 10, 2017@RusEmbUSA Is that today?

 BOMBSHELL: FBI Admits They Are Directly Investigating Donald Trump,"Donald Trump thanked outgoing FBI Director James Comey for informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation,  but it seems that The Donald is lying. The shocking firing of the man who was investigating Trump came just after the former FBI chief requested additional resources for the investigation  a sign that things were not going well for Trump and his accomplices. But you know what else is a sign that things aren t going well? The FBI just confirmed that they are investigating Trump directly despite his claims to the contrary.An open records request from The Sparrow Project reveals that there is an  active ongoing investigation  into Trump. The organization requested disclosure of any and all records, including investigative records, mentioning or referring to Donald J. Trump s statement on 27 July, 2016 [regarding Secretary Hillary Clinton s State Department emails],  Russia, if you re listening, I hope you re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,  and  I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. The FBI dragged its heels on the request, prompting a lawsuit demanding that the FOIA request be fulfilled. The Bureau had initially refused to confirm nor deny the existence of any records related to the request, but that changed in the agency s legal response, which confirms an  active, ongoing investigation  and says the FBI is concerned that any release could  reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. It s worth noting that the requested records were not related to Trump s associates or Russian accomplices   the request solely related to him and his demand that Russia hack Hillary Clinton.Things are bad for the Russia administration   and they are only going to get much worse after Trump s attempt to interfere with the investigation.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"May 10, 2017"
" Trump Explains Why He Fired James Comey, F*cks Up And Admits He Should Be Impeached (VIDEO)","After kicking the morning off with a tweet storm attacking Democrats for criticizing his choice to fire FBI Director James Comey, Trump only seemed to make matters worse as the day went on.While meeting with pool reporters in the White House, Trump gave a public explanation for the termination of Comey, and accidentally made himself look horrible in the process. Keeping his message short and sweet, Trump said that the reason he fired Comey was because: He wasn t doing a good job, very simply. He was not doing a good job. You can watch that baffling moment below, where Trump cluelessly insults himself and ignored every question about Russia before kicking all the reporters out:That s certainly a strange thing for Trump to say, because by now he must know that his own approval rating is historically low and it continues to plummet with every failure his administration suffers. If Trump agrees that an FBI Director can be fired for their poor performance, it only makes sense that the same should apply to Trump.There s overwhelming evidence that Trump s job performance sucks   and it s not just his disastrous approval rating or the fact that polls show that most Americans want him out. From Trump s failed Muslim travel ban to his disgusting American Health Care Act (Trumpcare), Trump s first 100 days have been filled with failure after failure. There have been several times where Trump had to resort to taking credit for former President Barack Obama s work just to save his image.America is so much worse off now that Trump is in the White House, and if the country has to suffer through the rest of his term, the damage may be irreversible by the time we get a more qualified POTUS. But today, Trump accidentally said those magic words: if Comey can be fired for doing a bad job, so should he.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2017"
 WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Wore Out Her Welcome On CNN As Soon As She Opened Her Mouth,"CNN host Anderson Cooper s reactions to Kellyanne Conway throughout this interview are priceless.After firing FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, the wicked witch of the White House made her return to the cable news circuit to spout more bullshit in defense of her mentally defective boss.Conway was repeatedly reminded that Trump loved Comey during the 2016 campaign, but she repeatedly made an ass of herself by pretending that candidate Trump no longer exists. As a candidate, Donald Trump praised James Comey,  Cooper said.  Donald Trump talked about this on the campaign all the time. All of sudden the White House is concerned about James Comey s handling of Hillary Clinton s email? I think you re looking at the wrong set of facts here, Anderson,  Conway bewilderingly replied.  In other words you re going back to the campaign. This is the president of the United States, he acted decisively today, he acted at the direction of his deputy attorney general. He makes complete sense because he has lost confidence in the FBI director and he took the recommendation of Rob Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who has been on the job for two weeks. Cooper then proceeded to grill Conway. That makes no sense,  he fired back.  He said one thing as candidate and now he s concerned as president? Clearly, this White House is under investigation, the people around the president are under investigation. You would agree with that, yes? In defiance of the facts, Conway disagreed and whined about people who are  obsessed  with Russia. Then she argued that since she s around Trump and not under investigation that others cannot be. I m around the president,  Conway said.  I m not under investigation. So that person doesn t exist anymore?  Cooper asked.  Candidate Donald Trump, that s a fictional character we are no longer allowed to refer to? We can only refer to the Donald Trump who exists today? Conway accused Cooper of being mean and claimed that Trump fired Comey because he  needs confidence in his FBI director and he doesn t have it. Throughout the interview, Cooper can be seen reacting to Conway s most inane responses with facial expressions. At one point, he even rolled his eyes because of how ridiculous her answers were.Here s the video via YouTube.Clearly, CNN wasted their time and ours by inviting Conway on to spread Trump s propaganda. The only thing saving this interview is Copper s reactions to being gaslighted.The only reason why Trump fired Comey is because the FBI is investigating his Russia scandal. Trump just impeded that investigation and obstructed justice by firing the man in charge of it. Now Trump will likely put someone in charge who will drop the investigation. This is exactly the kid of shady shit that Richard Nixon did in order to cover-up his involvement in Watergate. He resigned rather than face impeachment. Trump should not only face impeachment, he should actually be impeached and put in prison.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"May 10, 2017"
 Kellyanne Conway Threatens Media: It’s ‘Inappropriate’ To Question Comey’s Firing (VIDEO),"On Tuesday, the United States received a major blow against system of checks and balances when Donald Trump clumsily and unceremoniously fired FBI Director James Comey right after Comey testified in front of a Senate panel about the administration s Russian connections. Now, it seems, the administration wants to stifle another critical part of our democracy   the media, who according to Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway, has no right to ask about the firing.Conway, who dialed her smug mean girl persona up to 11 for CNN s Chris Cuomo, was adamant in the idea that the media would be acting inappropriately if they did their job in questioning the very suspicious timing of the firing. In fact, asserted Conway, Trump will do what he wants when he wants (isn t that the calling card of a dictator?). You want to question when he hires, when he fires. That s inappropriate,  she said.  He ll do it when he wants to. Despite the fact that the timing of and the reason for the firing doesn t pass the sniff test, Conway continued to assert the administration line that Comey was fired over the Clinton emails. In the past, Trump had praised Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton emails, but yesterday he fired him for the same thing? The idea that you think this was about Russia and not about an FBI director who just forced his bureau to correct sworn testimony that Huma Abedin forwarded hundreds of thousands of emails,  Conway said, trailing off. President Trump wants an FBI director who is impartial, who is not politicized, who has the trust of the FBI and Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill,  she added.  There are any number of issues and evens that brought the president to this decision.

" Advisers Leak What Trump Does When He Sees Russia Scandal On TV — It’s Really, Really Weird","When getting to the truth behind Donald Trump s scandals, there s probably nothing more revealing than Trump s Twitter history and his erratic behavior. Time and time again, we ve seen that when Trump s scandals begin to close in on him, he just gets crazier and does whatever he can to distract from the situation. And if his public behavior wasn t concerning enough, what Trump does behind the closed doors of the White House is even worse.According to a new report from Politico, Trump can t even act like a mature grown up when he watches television and sees segments about his Russia scandal. Behaving more like an old bitter retiree than the sitting President of the United States, Trump apparently can t contain himself and resorts to yelling at the television.Politico states that  two advisers  said that Trump would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe  into his Russia investigation. Because that s not incriminating or weird at all, right?Honestly, the best thing Trump could do for his scandals and public image is to just stay the hell away from social media and cable TV   but we all know that Trump can t do that. And as long as Trump lacks the self control to manage his emotions or the insane amount of television and social media he consumes, these outbursts are going to get him in even more trouble.This information from Trump s advisers shows that Trump will do anything to make this scandal go away   to the degree that he has to scream at televisions to vent his anger. This kind of uncontrollable rage is exactly what the majority of Americans who voted against Trump were afraid of   a man this unhinged should never have access to nuclear codes. With any luck, Trump s scandals will be his downfall and we won t have to deal with him much longer.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2017"
 ‘Turn The Lights Off!’: Spicer Literally Hid In the Bushes From Reporters After Trump Fired Comey,"Brave White House press secretary Sean Spicer had an odd appropriate reaction after his boss abruptly fired the man who was leading an investigation into his administration s ties to Russia. Spicer had just finished a brief interview with Fox Business from the White House grounds late Tuesday night then he took cover in the bushes to avoid questions, according to The Washington Post. Spicer huddled with his staff behind a tall hedge. To get back to his office, Spicer would have to pass a swarm of reporters wanting to know why Trump abruptly fired FBI director James Comey.The White House press secretary had to get back to his office somehow but to do that he needed to pass a swarm of reporters.Spicer and his staff turned themselves into pretzels for hours in an attempt to defend Trump s bizarre decision to fire Comey.The Washington Post reports:Spicer had wanted to drop the bombshell news in an emailed statement, but it was not transmitting quickly enough, so he ended up standing in the doorway of the press office around 5:40 p.m. and shouting a statement to reporters who happened to be nearby. He then vanished, with his staff locking the door leading to his office. The press staff said that Spicer might do a briefing, then announced that he definitely wouldn t say anything more that night. But as Democrats and Republicans began to criticize and question the firing with increasing levels of alarm, Spicer and two prominent spokeswomen were suddenly speed-walking up the White House drive to defend the president on CNN, Fox News and Fox Business.Between appearances, Spicer spent several minutes hidden in the bushes, as one does when their boss is totally not guilty. Janet Montesi, an executive assistant in the press office, emerged from the bushes (and this does not look suspicious at all) and told reporters that Spicer would answer some questions, as long as they did not film him. That s when Spicer came out of his safe place to face questions from reporters. Just turn the lights off. Turn the lights off,  Spicer demanded.  We ll take care of this.   Can you just turn that light off? Spicer s wish was granted and he found himself standing in near darkness between two tall hedges, with more than a dozen reporters closely gathered around him. For 10 minutes, he responded to a flurry of questions.Spicer had to answer questions as he stammered and hemmed and hawed. Spicer was asked when Trump and Comey spoke? last.  Uh, I don t know.

I have said from the get-go that I think a special prosecutor is the way to go, but now with what s happened it is the only way to go,  Schumer told reporters on Tuesday.Instead, McConnell said he would leave that up to the FBI   and let Jeff Sessions handpick Comey s  interim  (read: non-confirmed) FBI head, something that is not standard procedure.News: AG Sessions & Deputy AG Rosenstein interviewing potential interim FBI directors today, according to a DOJ official (@LauraAJarrett)  David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) May 10, 2017Another deeply disturbing sign they need a handpicked interim Director?

Even if a full-time replacement eventually comes along, the dysfunction and partisanship created in this scenario could make the entire case dissolve. If you were a witness who knew of criminal wrongdoing from someone on Trump s team and you just watched the FBI director get fired and replaced by someone handpicked by Trump s close friend would you want to come forward? It s clear Trump sure hopes not.McConnell is enabling all of this. As usual. In a show of loyalty to the president, McConnell slammed Democrats who had called for an independent investigation and instead went on a lengthy rant about Obamacare and what he thought of as  Democratic hypocrisy. Senator McConnell has decided to side with the White House in their spin that they fired Director Comey as a favor to Democrats.  Matt House (@mattwhouse) May 10, 2017In a moment where the country can be said to be facing a real constitutional crisis, McConnell is choosing to smear his Democratic enemies and stand with undemocratic strongarm tactics from a president.

 REPORT: Comey Firing Was Nothing More Than A Trump Tantrum Over Russia,"Everyone is rightfully stunned and outraged that Donald Trump decided to inexplicably fire the man who was investigating his 2016 presidential campaign s ties to Russia, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey. People are (also rightfully) suggesting that this firing is all part of a cover-up   an attempt to squash the Russia investigation. While there was likely nervousness related to the Russia investigation that went into this decision, there is a much more Trumpian reason for it, according to Politico: a Trump temper tantrum over the media s coverage of the criminal probe into the possibility of Trump/Russia collusion.Comey recently testified on Capitol Hill that there is an ongoing investigation into Russia s 2016 election meddling. Said probe includes the possibility that Trump campaign officials coordinated with the Russians in an attempt to tip the election to Trump. Of course, Trump was outraged at this public scrutiny, and his ego cannot take the idea that anything but his own supposed brilliance won him the election. From Politico:He had grown enraged by the Russia investigation, two advisers said, frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around Russia. He repeatedly asked aides why the Russia investigation wouldn t disappear and demanded they speak out for him. He would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe, one adviser said.So, there you have it. Trump was angry that Comey s testimony had brought the Russia story that refuses to go away back into the spotlight, and he was angry at his and his staff s inability to control it. Trump has reportedly been considering getting rid of Comey for roughly a week,  which would mean that it was right around the time of Comey s Capitol Hill testimony that the easily agitated president put his FBI Director in the line of fire over Russia.This is nothing short of a Constitutional crisis. We have no choice but to DEMAND a 9/11-style independent commission on Russia, as well as a special prosecutor for this case. No one appointed by Trump   ESPECIALLY Attorney General Jeff Sessions   should be anywhere near this probe.This isn t partisan. This is about the soul of the republic, and we must get to the bottom of this, even as Trump continues to make Nixonian moves in fits of rage and attempts at cover-ups.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2017"
 Trump Just Made His 2 Most DUNDERHEADED Moves Yet After Firing Comey (DETAILS),"As if firing FBI Director James Comey wasn t stupid enough, Trump has gone and driven two more nails into his own coffin this evening. First, he hired an outside law firm to send a certified letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that heard testimony from James Clapper and Sally Yates on May 8, regarding the Russia probe.Second, he s meeting with Vladimir Putin s top diplomat to the U.S., Sergey Lavrov, in the White House Wednesday morning. The Associated Press says that this could be a signal that our relationship with Russia is improving again, but in the wake of the clusterfuck that was Trump s entire Tuesday, this does not look good at all.First, the law firm and the letter. Trump wants the letter to Sen. Graham to claim that he has no connections to Russia.Seriously.He s hired an outside law firm to draft and send a letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham claiming that he has no connections business or otherwise to Russia. Because obviously.But wait! This move achieves the impossible by getting even more ridiculous than that! Sean Spicer briefed the White House press corps on this development, and said: The president, obviously, was aware of Senator Graham s suggestion after he made it today and he s fine with that. He has no business in Russia. He has no connections to Russia. So he welcomes that.In fact, he is already charged a leading law firm in Washington, D.C., to send a certified letter to Senator Graham to that point that he has no connections to Russia. If he knows he s got no connections at all to Russia, and he knows he s completely innocent of all these allegations, then why hire an outside law firm to send a letter to Sen. Graham reiterating that? That s not what someone who s sure of their innocence does.Now, his meeting with Lavrov is taking place after Lavrov meets with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Both meetings will supposedly focus on stabilizing Syria   the Trump administration seems to think that we need to work with Russia to accomplish anything there. But, as the AP notes in their story: [T]he meeting will be impossible to separate from the Trump administration s unfolding political drama in Washington, where FBI and congressional investigations are looking into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and the Kremlin related to last year s presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies accuse Moscow of meddling to help Trump s chances of victory. That, combined with this letter he s sending to Sen. Graham (and we have to wonder exactly how such a letter is going to prove that he s got no connections to Russia at all), just looks really, really bad. In fact, it s starting to look like the world is about to come crashing down around him.Featured image by Olivier Douliery   Pool via Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2017"
 Ranking Dem On House Russia Probe Has EXPLOSIVE News For Trump That Will Have Him Running Scared,"As everybody who still believes in democracy and true freedom reels from FBI Director James Comey s firing, the media and members of Congress have been frantically working to get the deets on what happened. Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee (which is conducting its own investigation into Russia), just dropped a truth bomb about Comey, and Trump would be wise to go find a cave and hide in it now.Schiff was asked, on CNN, whether he believes this is a cover-up. He doesn t. He thinks it s something worse: It s a brazen interference with a criminal investigation. After all, the president calls this whole investigation a fake, and here you had an FBI director who was seriously looking into whether Trump associates were colluding with the Russians. The end of his statement to CNN should be particularly jarring to anybody familiar with history. Watch below:Rep. Adam Schiff on firing of FBI Director James Comey:  It s a brazen interference with a criminal investigation  https://t.co/5SXgAuTVBP  CNN (@CNN) May 10, 2017Earlier this year, the White House tried to get the FBI to publicly dispute stories appearing in The New York Times about contacts between Trump s associates and Russian actors. They ve been trying to bend the FBI to their will for a long time, and when Comey wouldn t lie under oath for them, or end his Russia probe, Trump decided to fire him.In fact, Jeff Sessions was actually told to find reasons to fire Comey, and they ve been working on it for at least a week. Trump likely wants someone in that position who ll end that investigation before they discover something really damning. He wants a puppet.If Trump was innocent, the White House wouldn t have been looking for reasons to fire Comey now. Comey may not have even been fired, but if he was, Trump probably would have done it when he took office under the guise of getting a fresh start, as Schiff said to CNN. This is not the behavior of an innocent man.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2017"
 Comey Learned He Was Fired When Background TVs Flashed The News While He Was Giving A Speech,"Trump is famous for his  You re fired  catchphrase, but when it comes to actually firing someone, he s shown nothing but cowardice. His inability to face the person he s about to get rid of led to an incredibly humiliating moment for James Comey.Standing in front of an audience of FBI employees, Comey was reportedly mid-speech when phones began lighting up and the televisions dialed into cable news in the background broke the news that Comey should have been the first to hear: Donald Trump just fired you.According to the New York Times, the moment was understandably sheer chaos in the room:Mr. Comey, who is three years into a 10-year term at the helm of the F.B.I., learned from news reports that he had been fired while addressing bureau employees in Los Angeles. While Mr. Comey spoke, television screens in the background began flashing the news that he had been fired. Shortly thereafter, a letter was delivered to the F.B.I. s headquarters in Washington.The sheer lack of professionalism was so inconceivable that Comey laughed when he saw it and told the crowd that it was a great prank they just pulled.In response, Mr. Comey laughed, saying he thought it was a fairly funny prank.Then his staff started scurrying around in the background and told Mr. Comey that he should step into a nearby office.Nobody at the FBI was reportedly told ahead of time that their boss was about to be terminated. People are freaking out   even those within the White House.Another administration official described that the decision which caught FBI officials and top lawmakers completely off-guard on Tuesday was  kept very close to the chest  within Trump s inner political circle up until the moment  [we] were ready to pull the trigger  on axing Comey.Adding insult to injury, Trump s abrupt firing of Comey leaves the now former FBI director stranded in Los Angeles.Legitimate question about how Comey will get home from LA. He's there with FBI plane. Does Trump allow him to fly home on it?  Michael S. Schmidt (@nytmike) May 9, 2017Trump himself appears to have ordered his Attorney General to start finding reasons to fire Comey  at least a week ago    around the same time Trump went on Twitter to suggest Comey was in the tank for Hillary.Sessions was ordered to find a reason to fire Sessions a week ago. This is what Trump was tweeting a week ago pic.twitter.com/uiOHsOR4WD  Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) May 9, 2017In his letter to Comey, Trump says he couldn t allow him to continue as FBI director and implied it was due to his refusal to publicly state that there was no investigation into Trump s connection to Russia. (Note: Testifying to that would have required Comey to perjure himself because there is an on-going investigation into Trump s connection to Russia.)In short: The White House is once again in complete chaos and the only person responsible is Trump himself.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2017"
" Gizmodo Tricks James Comey, Trump Advisers Into Responding To Blatantly Obvious Email Hack Attempt","Trump and his team made a great deal of the campaign about Hillary Clinton s email security (including gleefully exploiting hacked emails stolen by Russia and released by Wikileaks), so one might think their own email security practices would be stellar. Alas, like so many of Trump s criticism of Hillary, his team s own security efforts are much, much worse.To prove this point, tech site Gizmodo created a  test  to see how well Trump s staff handles email security. Adding even more fuel to the fire, they also included James Comey   who had played a central role in perpetuating lies about Hillary Clinton s emails in the days leading up to the election.Three weeks ago, Gizmodo Media Group s Special Projects Desk launched a security preparedness test directed at Giuliani and 14 other people associated with the Trump Administration. We sent them an email that mimicked an invitation to view a spreadsheet in Google Docs. The emails came from the address [email protected], but the sender name each one displayed was that of someone who might plausibly email the recipient, such as a colleague, friend, or family member.Disturbingly, a number of Trump associates fell for it.Some of the Trump Administration people completely ignored our email, the right move. But it appears that more than half the recipients clicked the link: Eight different unique devices visited the site, one of them multiple times. There s no way to tell for sure if the recipients themselves did all the clicking (as opposed to, say, an IT specialist they d forwarded it to), but seven of the connections occurred within 10 minutes of the emails being sent.Even more disturbing, both Newt Gingrich and (now former FBI director) James Comey seemed to buy into the premise, while remaining slightly skeptical. Comey, for instance, asked the sender to explain to him what was in the attached document. Surely a better response than just clicking on it, but still dangerous. By asking a potential hacker to explain him or herself, the (former) FBI director only opened the door to further chances to be hacked. He also appeared to believe the email was really from a friend based solely on the name attached the the email account.Is it legal to do this? Some journalists were skeptical.@ashleyfeinberg Did did Gizmodo send the FBI director a spoofed email and then confess to the federal crime at the FBI director s expense on Gizmodo?  Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) May 9, 2017However, Gizmodo s defense is pretty solid. For starters, they never collected any actual passwords or contact information for any of the recipients (regardless of whether the marks took the bait). Secondly, they slapped so many disclaimers on the emails that you would have to be extremely oblivious to not understand what was happening   a test which, it turns out, some of Trump s friends seem to have failed.For journalistic reasons it provides a lot of insight into just how susceptible some of Trump s closest advisers are to being hacked. Far from having the moral high ground to lecture Democrats, it turns out that Trump s team is comprised of technology-challenged suckers capable of exposing a lot of sensitive information to would-be hackers. If Gizmodo can trick them with an email containing numerous disclaimers that this was a potential hack, a real hack   infinitely more subtle   could be a serious threat.Comey himself acknowledged that it appears Russian attempts to hack America s democracy appears to be ongoing and warned that it would likely rear its ugly head in 2018 and 2020. He should be extra cautious.Meanwhile, it s unlikely that Trump will be able to appropriately respond to this threat. He may not even recognize it exists. He talked a mean game about Hillary s email security, but the closest he ever came to commenting on his own understanding of cyberwarfare was claiming his 10-year-old son Barron was good with computers. Given that level of ignorance, Trump isn t likely to start leading by example.Yikes.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2017"
 Fear Of Being Defeated By Elizabeth Warren In 2020 Has Trump FREAKING OUT,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been the object of some serious concern in the White House due to her potential as a 2020 presidential challenger, despite the fact she has said she will not run.The White House is teaming up with the Republican National Committee (RNC) to dig up whatever they can on Warren   and whatever they can fabricate   so they can circulate condemning memos to reporters.Meanwhile, aides in the White House are keeping tabs on Warren s criticism of Trump and have used the media to aggressively hit back. Last month The Hill published the Senator s criticism of America s largest non-nuclear bomb being dropped in Afghanistan, the White House quickly scrambled with a rebuttal   an unusually high level of concern over one senator. As somebody who is probably, in the hearts and minds of liberal activists, a leader of the party, that voice carries some weight, and we have to respond,  said a White House official who wishes to remain anonymous.In an effort to put down the Senator, Trump brought back his favorite   and most offensive   Warren insults last month, referring to her as  Pocahontas  while delivering a speech to the National Rifle Associate. I have a feeling that in the next election, you re going to be swamped with candidates,  said Trump.  It may be Pocahontas, remember that. Many see Warren as a likely 2020 presidential candidate, and when Trump can t find legitimated faults with his adversaries, he cowardly resorts to racial insults as attempts to make them look bad. Warren has abstained from engaging in name calling, despite what the Trump administration has to say about her. Elizabeth Warren is the perfect foil for the Trump administration,  says former Trump aide Sam Nunberg.  I always thought she would be the new Rosie [O Donnell]. Our base hates her; we think she s a joke. She s somebody to galvanize us. It was very smart for the president to bring her up at the NRA. The White House claims they are focused on governing but believe they also need to brand the Massachusetts Senator as out of touch and unfit for the presidency, while she holds a 56 percent approval rating nationwide in a recent survey by Morning Consult.It seems the White House isn t very good at hiding the fact they are seriously afraid of Warren s momentum and her potential to reach the blue-collar voters who backed Trump. Luckily, Trump s racist name calling makes him look bad, not her.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2017"
 AG Sessions Toys With Ending Russia Investigation Completely Minutes After Firing The Guy Heading It,"Those who know anything about Nixon know this story: Minutes after Trump s White House fired FBI Director James Comey, his Attorney General Jeff Sessions toyed with scrapping the entire Russia investigation. Until around 6:30 pm on Tuesday, Comey was heading that investigation. Until around 6:30 pm on Tuesday, Comey was scheduled to testify in front of a Senate hearing about that investigation.When Democrats asked Sessions about the fate of the investigation, Sessions demurred.Dem Dick Durbin says AG not saying if will continue FBI investigation into Russia and possible links with Trump associates. @StevenTDennis  Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) May 9, 2017Sessions is leaving open the possibility of just killing the Russia investigation outright. https://t.co/fexvP1tohX  Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) May 9, 2017And there s this, conveyed by Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand:AG Sessions lied under oath about meetings with Kislyak. One way to exert control after recusal is by getting rid of FBI Director. Chilling.  Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) May 9, 2017For those keeping score at home, this is the part in Watergate where Nixon abruptly fired the special prosecutor looking into his crimes and closed down the investigation. The attempt to quash the charges backfired spectacularly, hastening Nixon s ouster. Will Trump s team make the same mistake? Only time will tell.Trump himself made it clear in his letter to Comey that his firing was related to improperly supporting him during public hearings on the FBI investigation into Trump s connections to Russia. Trump appears to be unable to grasp that the investigation is ongoing, despite his baffling conclusion to the contrary.Detail from Trump's letter to Comey. pic.twitter.com/69aWfdffxg  Philip Bump (@pbump) May 9, 2017Republicans have, even by their objectively low standards, behaved with appalling recklessness in defense of Trump. In the most recent example of party over country, Republican senators attempted to hijack and derail Sally Yates  testimony about Trump s actions regarding Michael Flynn and Russia. Ted Cruz was particularly awful. Moments after hearing both Yates and former director of national intelligence James Clapper swear under oath that Trump had been warned that Flynn had opened himself up to blackmail   a major scandal   he tried to turn the hearing into an investigation into Hillary s emails. Seriously.The charade is already beginning.Prediction: every single Republican (with a few tiny exceptions) will fall into line.  Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) May 9, 2017The efforts by the GOP to let Trump go un-investigated are what stand out as the great divide between Nixon and now. It s an open question as to whether there is any crime, nor any evidence, that would be damning enough for Republicans to set aside their own partisanship and greed to take action. What s more, men like Jeff Sessions have made it abundantly clear that they aren t afraid to get their hands dirty to keep Trump s ill-fitting suit and overly long tie clean.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2017"
 Russia Testimony Heats Up; Trump CLEANS HOUSE On Key Investigators (DETAILS),"The investigation into possible collusion between Donald Trump s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia is heating up. On Monday, former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, along with former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. There were bombshell revelations in that testimony that directly contradicted the accounts regarding the actions and conduct that led to the firing of former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn that were told by the White House. Now, as the lies keep being exposed, Trump has gone even further into the arena of attempting a cover-up of the whole Russia deal by firing FBI Director James Comey.Now, it could be argued that Comey had his thumb on the scale for Trump, considering the letter he sent to House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz just eleven days from Election Day that detailed the FBI s intent to re-open investigations into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s private email server. However, now that Comey has testified just last week that there are ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign s possible coordination with the Russian government to fix an election, Comey is out. The White House released the following statement regarding Comey s firing: Today, President Donald J. Trump informed FBI Director James Comey that he has been terminated and removed from office. President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Here is a shot of the entire letter:Trump himself went on to say in a statement: The FBI is one of our Nation s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement. Crown jewel indeed. It s only a crown jewel in their eyes if they show unwavering loyalty to Trump.Considering that Sessions had to recuse himself from any and all investigations related to Russia and the Trump team, this stinks to high heaven. In other words, Team Trump is getting rid of anyone and everyone who would be able to blow the whistle on anything resembling collusion. These people are balls deep in collusion with the Kremlin.This is what a coup looks like, folks. Sessions, Trump, and all the rest are cleaning house in an effort to get rid of anyone who could tell the truth about what REALLY happened to fix the 2016 election in Donald Trump s   and Vladimir Putin s   favor.This is a developing story.

 WATCH: Sean Spicer Just Defended Michael Flynn While Attacking Sally Yates,"Following Sally Yates  testimony yesterday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday accused the former acting Attorney General of being a  political opponent of the president  because she informed the White House three times that then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied about his contacts with Russia. Spicer was asked why it took Trump 18 days to fire Flynn after it was revealed by Yates that he had been  compromised  and was vulnerable to being blackmailed by Russia.Spicer said that Flynn was not fired immediately because of  an element of due process  after the White House  was informed of [Yates] giving us a heads up. Somebody came over, gave us a heads up, told us there were materials,  Spicer said.  Ultimately, the president made a decision that was the right one. So, I think the process worked. According to Spicer, Trump defended Flynn after learning that he lied because he is  somebody who served our country honorably in uniform for over 30 years. The president does not want to smear a good man,  Spicer continued.  Let s look at how this came down. Someone who is not exactly a supporter of the president s agenda who a couple of days after this conversation took place refused to uphold a lawful order of the president who was not exactly excited about President Trump by taking office or his agenda. Just because someone gives you a heads up doesn t mean you jump the gun and go take action,  Spicer added.  What if we just dismissed someone because a political opponent of the president had made an utterance, you would argue that it s pretty irrational. Watch:Spicer also said that Yates was a  strong supporter of Clinton,  however, he said that without offering proof of such.  It was widely rumored,  Spicer said.Watch:lol, reporter asked Spicer why he claimed Yates was  strong supporter of Hillary Clinton,  Spicer OF COURSE says  it was rumored  pic.twitter.com/UgWmZ1Rol6  Tommy Christopher (@tommyxtopher) May 9, 2017Spicer called Sally Yates, who has served under Republican and Democratic Presidents, and served in the Justice Department for nearly three decades with an unblemished record,  a political opponent.  Let that sink in.In February, Trump referred to Flynn as a  wonderful man  and blamed the  fake media  for  criminal  leaks.

 White House Says It’s Releasing Hillary’s Private Concession Call To Trump In Bid To Humiliate Her,"Trump s emotionally unbalanced social media director and close friend Dan Scavino had what can only be described as a mental break and is now threatening to publish a video of the private concession call she placed to Trump (and appears to have been answered by Kellyanne Conway).To do so would be not only a major ethical violation but would break with the long-standing tradition of the winners showing an ounce of graciousness towards their opponents. Trump and his team apparently have no qualms with stooping this low. If there is a point of indignity even they will not cross, they have yet to reach it.Scavino has long relished in his role as Trump s nastiest bulldog. His position as White House social media director was handed to him, not due to experience or expertise but because he was Trump s golf caddie. In a White House bursting with nepotism and corruption, Scavino might be the least qualified person around   an impressive feat. He is also known for his viciousness and an unhinged streak of petty attacks on his or Trump s perceived enemies follows wherever he goes. Clinton, who won the popular vote by several million, still irritates Trump and therefore she is an enemy Scavino feels he needs to destroy.For his part, Scavino claims he is being trolled by Hillary supporters. A notable coward, he couldn t take the heat and began melting down on social media. (The irony of Trump s social media director being unable to handle being on social media should not be lost on anyone.)After posting this nonsensical  I m not mad, you re mad!  tweet, Scavino followed it up with the promise to release Hillary s concession phone call.Love @AlexBWall & team Clinton trolling me (b/c they have nothing else going on.)

Trump s team of enablers and yes-men run from one squabble to the next. Very little time appears to be spent on actual governance, with a lot of their energy being consumed with in-fighting. Bannon is fighting with Jared Kushner. Kushner is fighting with Priebus. Kellyanne Conway is missing? McMasters is fighting with Bannon. Instead of leading by example, Trump is off golfing or wandering around aimlessly with a copy of the election map under his arm. Trump ran an experiment: What would happen if I filled the nation s highest office with the least reputable, most angry, insecure people in the country? The answer: This shitshow is exactly what happens.The only goal of Scavino releasing the private tape of Trump and Clinton s phone call is to personally humiliate Hillary Clinton. There is no political, social, or practical reason to do this. Even by the admittedly low standards of restraint and goodwill on display by Trump s White House, this is disgusting. Sadly, with Trump consumed by his efforts to smear Sally Yates, it appears unlikely that he will intervene and save his administration from yet another self-inflicted blow to their own dignity.I would say this is the foxes running the henhouse but it would be unfair to suggest foxes lack this amount of shame.Featured image via CNN",News,"May 9, 2017"
 ACLU Issues Shocking Warning: It’s Not Safe To Travel In Texas,"The Americal Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a shocking warning on Tuesday: Thanks to the xenophobia of Donald Trump and his Republican cronies, it is no longer safe to travel in the state of Texas.The travel alert warns that  anyone planning to travel to Texas in the near future [should] anticipate the possible violation of their constitutional rights when stopped by law enforcement. The alert comes amid the passing of a Texas law known as SB4. The law gives a green light to police officers in the state to investigate a person s immigration status during a routine traffic stop, leading to widespread racial profiling, baseless scrutiny, and illegal arrests of citizens and non-citizens alike presumed to be  foreign  based on how they look or sound. The travel alert applies to all travelers to Texas, including U.S. travelers from other states and U.S. citizens. In addition, this alert applies to all encounters with federal, state, county law enforcement including local police and sheriffs.Constitutional rights no longer mean anything thanks to the hateful nature of Trump s administration. And Republicans, the very people who relentlessly scream about how important our  freedom  is, are ready to set a match to the Constitution as long as it gets rid of all those icky brown people. Even U.S. citizens aren t safe anymore. We plan to fight this racist and wrongheaded law in the courts and in the streets. Until we defeat it, everyone traveling in or to Texas needs to be aware of what s in store for them,  said Terri Burke, executive director of the ACLU of Texas.  The Lone Star State will become a  show me your papers  state, where every interaction with law enforcement can become a citizenship interrogation and potentially an illegal arrest. It is simply a matter of time before illegal arrests occur. Local law enforcement will have to decide between violating a person s rights and being severely fined, thrown in jail, or even being removed from office for choosing not to do so,  Burke added.Lorella Praeli, the ACLU s director of immigration policy and campaigns said, Everyone has constitutional rights in this country. The state of Texas, and every law enforcement officer, must respect those rights. The ACLU stands ready to safeguard those freedoms against those who seek to diminish them.

 Pastor Caught Trump’s Spiritual Advisor Stealing From Her Own Church Collection Plate,"It seems that Donald Trump s spiritual advisor is exactly as ethical as he is. Paula White, a prosperity gospel minister who prayed at The Donald s inauguration, has regularly been criticized by Trump s evangelical followers as a charlatan who essentially sells tickets to Heaven and other God-related non-products.White sells, for instance, a  resurrection seed    a delivery from a spiritual death sentence   for $1,144 (a number that was totally chosen by God). But apparently, the money she scams from her people by selling a la carte divine services isn t quite enough for White.Hector Gomez, who was a pastor at White s former Without Walls ministry in the 90 s, told HeatStreet that he once saw the  Christian  huckster cherrypicking the offering plate:Hector Gomez, a pastor who worked at Without Walls from 1993 to 2000, told Heat Street that on several occasions, Paula and Randy White invited people to put not only money in the offering plate but valuables, too. Darryl Strawberry, the famed outfielder, once caused a stir by putting his World Series ring in the offering plate and donating it to the church, Randy White told ESPN in 2009. People would give them jewelry, diamonds, watches,  Gomez said. One day, he said, he watched in horror as Paula White sifted through the collection plate after church, picking out the jewelry that looked valuable.White told him to take the less valuable collections to a jeweler who bought second-hand pieces to resell or melt down, he said; he watched her lock up the more valuable jewelry in her desk, and he never saw it again.Gomez said he felt ethically uncomfortable reselling congregants  jewelry. Not only was he unsure about what became of the most valuable items collected, he said; he also felt uneasy asking people for treasured jewelry, especially after his own wife donated a bracelet he d given her when they first got married. It wasn t worth much,  Gomez said.  It was a nice little bracelet. But it has sentimental value.  He said he thought about that bracelet as he watched White sort through the jewelry.  I was so grieved. I was like,  This belongs to the people in the church. They worked very hard. Trump says that he surrounds himself with the  very best people    but that phrase is quickly proving to be synonymous with  huckster.

He is signing her name   That would either indicate that Melania is completely illiterate, and even I don t believe that, or that she married a complete control freak. Either way, doesn t he have something better to do than micromanage his wife s communications?2. It s a stamp or a computer simulation   While this is the most likely scenario, it s only slightly less disturbing. If so, he clearly instructed someone to create a signature that was just.like.his. so his wife would only be seen as an extension of him and his gawdawful style. He s like one of those husbands who insists on a joint Facebook page.3. She has been trained to have a signature that looks just like his   Gross.4. She actually has a signature that looks just like his.   Very weird, but not entirely creepy.The least he could let her do is use an elegant pen instead of a sharpie.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images. ",News,"May 9, 2017"
 President Obama Tells Audience Why Americans Deserve Trump And Republicans,"President Obama took a trip to Milan, Italy this week and he laid down some cold, hard truths for America s liberals, telling us why we deserve Donald Trump and Paul Ryan and all of their reverse Robin Hood work of stealing from everyone to give to the rich.Eschewing a tie for a more fashion forward country, Obama told the Milan audience: People have a tendency to blame politicians when things don t work, but as I always tell people, you get the politicians you deserve,  Obama explained while the audience applauded.  And if you don t vote and you don t pay attention, you ll get policies that don t reflect your interest. Obama also told the audience that often times a mistake activists make  is not engaging people once they get attention. Source: Raw StoryWhile it sounds a bit harsh to say that we deserve the wannabe dictator Donald Trump, it s actually not too surprising coming from the man who began his political career as a community organizer. Obama has always realized the importance of civic engagement for everyone, not just for the people running for office.We live in a country where fewer than two-thirds of the people vote during presidential elections. In local elections (arguably the most important), turnout plummets to an embarrassing one-fifth of the population.There are some positive signs, though, which Obama spoke about just a few days after Trump was inaugurated.Former president Barack Obama said he s  heartened  by American civic engagement, following a weekend of spontaneous protests in the wake of President Donald Trump s executive order related to immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. Citizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake,  Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said Monday in a written statement.Source: CNBCObama s message, as always, is that yes, our democracy can be saved. The catch, though, is that we have to get off our collective asses to do it.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images.",News,"May 9, 2017"
 Trump’s EPA Just Fired Five Scientists To Make Room For Industry Insiders," Trump administration is keeping good on its promise to all but destroy U.S. environmental policy this week. The New York Times reports that Trump s EPA has let go of at least five scientific review board members, with plans to replace the academics with money hungry industry big-wigs. It seems Trump s goal is to shrink the EPA regulatory reach by taking science out of the picture altogether.J.P. Freire, a spokesperson for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt says Pruitt is considering industry representatives   the same polluters the EPA was designed to regulate   as replacements for the five scientists who are getting the boot. The administrator believes we should have people on this board who understand the impact of regulations on the regulated community,  Friere stated.This dismissal comes six weeks after the House moved forward a bill that pushes for more corporate representatives on another EPA scientific review board.Trump is calling for a radical remake of the EPA by implementing deep budget cuts   up to a 40 percent cut for scientific research   and instructing Mr. Pruitt to destroy essential Obama-era climate change and water protection regulations. Mr. Pruitt will likely follow Trump s direction seeing as he publicly denounces the established science that climate change is caused by humans.This move coincides with the Trump administration s current track record of putting people in charge of the agencies they want to destroy. The complete anti-science stance and defunding of scientific research by the Trump administration are unprecedented in U.S. presidential history.Trump is now taking the swamp water he promised to drain and is putting it in charge of destroying the environment.Featured image by Ron Sach-Pool via Getty Images ",News,"May 9, 2017"
 The Merriam-Webster Dictionary Just SAVAGED Trump For His F*cking Terrible Spelling (TWEETS),"On Monday, in a tweet intended to intimidate a witness, Donald Trump demanded that the Senate ask Sally Yates   the former acting Attorney General whom he fired for refusing to support an unconstitutional executive order  if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it  to White House  Council.  After seemingly half the internet showed up to tell him what an embarrassmnet he is to both himself and our country, Trump removed the tweet and replaced it with one that was almost as stupid, but was lacking the glaring error that told the world our alleged leader is so stupid that a literal piece of shit would do a better job running the show.One of the many, many people who mocked Trump was his greatest nemesis outside of facts and good hair stylists: the Merriam-Webster Twitter person.Okay, fine.

 White House Staff Reportedly Went Behind Trump’s Back On HUGE Issue Because Trump Is Too Reckless,"Remember when Trump said that we were done with NAFTA, and rumors swirled that he was drafting an executive order withdrawing us from the agreement? And remember how he softened that position very quickly? It seems that he wasn t the one to reach out to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on that, nor did Trudeau call him of his own accord.White House officials reached out to him behind Trump s back.Why? Because they were concerned that Trump would unilaterally yank us out of it, hurting multiple sectors of our economy and doing zero favors for Canada and Mexico as well. So, according to Canada s National Post newspaper, they contacted Trudeau themselves: The unconventional diplomatic manoeuvre  approaching the head of a foreign government to influence your own boss  proved decisive, as Trump thereafter abandoned his threat to pull out of NAFTA unilaterally, citing the arguments made by Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto as pivotal. Trump, in a childish tantrum, slapped a 20 percent tariff on imports of softwood lumber from Canada, claiming that our agreement with them over that was unfair. He wholly neglected other parts of our trade relationship with Canada, including the fact that they import a lot more dairy from us than they export to us.In other words, if Trump would actually take a look at how things are working, he might find that things aren t quite as unfair to us as he makes them out to be with his tantrums.Trump has also threatened to levy massive taxes on products imported from Rexnord a company that just closed its Indiana plant and laid off more than 300 workers as punishment for sending its jobs to Mexico:Rexnord of Indiana made a deal during the Obama Administration to move to Mexico.

That s a far cry from  no evidence. The real story   the one Trump doesn t want you to know   is that Sally Yates confirmed under oath that she warned Donald Trump General Mike Flynn was compromised 18 days before Trump did anything about it.

 Trump Has Extremely Inappropriate Reaction To Being Contradicted By His Own National Security Adviser,"The majority of America has already noticed   and figured it out a long time ago   that Donald Trump doesn t have a measured, steady reaction to anything. Widely known for his lack of mental and emotional stability, America s new failing president continues to horrify the nation (and the world) with his over-the-top, inappropriate reactions to even the most straightforward issues and disagreements. How Trump treats members of his own team is a perfect example of this.Last month, Trump made a controversial remark when he insisted that South Korea should pay for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), a missile defense system that would help keep North Korea at bay. As Trump frequently talks out of his a** and makes statements that have no basis in reality, he was quickly contradicted by his own National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster. In a public statement, McMaster stepped in and quickly assured the Korean government that the cost of THAAD would be taken care of by the United States. Apparently, Trump didn t take that too well.According to Bloomberg, it s just been revealed that Trump lost his sh*t over this and tore his own adviser a new one over the phone. Bloomberg reported: Trump was livid, according to three White House officials, after reading in the Wall Street Journal that McMaster had called his South Korean counterpart to assure him that the president s threat to make that country pay for a new missile defense system was not official policy. These officials say Trump screamed at McMaster on a phone call, accusing him of undercutting efforts to get South Korea to pay its fair share. Trump, as usual, was having a highly inappropriate reaction to his fragile ego being bruised. Apparently, this isn t even the first and only time something like this has happened. Bloomberg stated that in private, Trump calls McMaster the general undermining my policy  and appears regretful that he appointed him.The lack of trust and in-fighting we ve seen in the Trump administration   as well as Trump s lack of respect for the advisers HE appointed   is unprecedented on so many levels. This administration continues to be an embarrassment to this country, and most of us can t wait until this nightmare is over.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"May 8, 2017"
 Condoleezza Rice: ‘America Was Born With A Birth Defect – Slavery’ (VIDEO),"Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sat down for an interview on Sunday and had a few words to say about the birth of America, which was plagued by slavery from its very conception.While discussing her newest book, Democracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom,  Rice told CBS  Sunday Morning that the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s was the second founding of America. We forget in the United States how long it has taken us to make  We the People  mean people like me. And indeed, I do think that America was born with a birth defect; it was slavery. And so I do think that when we were finally able to deliver the promise of the Constitution to people like me, little girls growing up in Birmingham, Alabama, when finally my father was able to vote without difficulty, yes, it s the second founding of America. The first founding wasn t quite complete. Rice, who spent eight years in the White House serving as national security adviser and secretary of state under President George W. Bush, also called forth a memory from her childhood during the interview. She grew up in Alabama, where Jim Crow was the law of the land. In the summers, her family would travel to Denver. However, these were not your average family vacations. Rather, they were a quest for an education denied to them because of the color of their skin. If you were black, you couldn t go to the University of Alabama for graduate school in 1961,  she said.  And so my father, who was getting an advanced degree in student personnel administration, and my mother, who was qualifying to teach music in the schools   she was a science teacher before that   would go to Denver.

And it does not exist in the world of Donald Trump. This is the most important election of the last hundred years,  she said.

 Sally Yates Just Opened A Can Of Constitutional Whoop Ass On Ted Cruz (VIDEO),"During testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates revealed that she warned Trump administration officials three times about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The hearing today involved Russia s meddling in the 2016 election so of course, Ted Cruz grilled Yates about her thoughts on Trump s attempt to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. That, of course, makes no sense but Cruz was trying to defend the man who previously insulted his wife s looks during the campaign.Yates was fired as acting AG after refusing to defend Trump s executive order, which she said violated the U.S. Constitution s religious protections.Cruz told Yates that the Office of Legal Counsel had issued a determination that the executive order was legal, but Yates countered that finding by saying it ignored the First Amendment in favor of an obscure statute which had since been updated. In this particular instance, particularly where we were talking about a fundamental issue of religious freedom, not the interpretation of some arcane statute, but religion freedom, it was appropriate for us to look at the intent behind the president s actions and the intent is laid out in his statements,  Yates said.Yates said she did not believe Trump s executive order was  lawful  and used  religious freedom  to defend herself from Cruz s attack on her.When Cruz quoted part of the Constitution, Yates came back at him with a statute which she said  Trumps the first one you described. In the over 200 years of the Department of Justice history, are you aware of any instance in which the Department of Justice has formally approved the legality of a policy and three days later the attorney general has directed the department not to follow that policy and to defy that policy?  Cruz asked. I m not, but I m also not aware of a situation where the Office of Legal Counsel was advised not to tell the attorney general about it until after it was over,  Yates replied.Watch:Rep. John Cornyn, too, brought up the Executive Order to Yates and that didn t go down well either. Yates brought up  intent  again in regards to Trump s Muslim ban. In fact, just this morning after White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked by ABC s Cecilia Varga about the alleged president s website literally having the words  preventing Muslim immigration  written on it, it was scrubbed.So now we re back to the  intent  behind Trump s executive order again.One does not simply delete something from the Internet, though.Moments after Spicer was asked about this Trump campaign page calling for a Muslim ban, it went blank.

" Officials: Obama Warned About Flynn, But Trump Thought He Was Joking","The Trump administration has finally, definitively, admitted that President Obama personally warned Donald Trump about hiring Michael Flynn within 48 hours of the election .The conversation occurred during the 90-minute sitdown the former President and the guy who was kinda-sorta elected by a minority of the population (and Russia) and against the wishes of most Americans.A senior Obama official tells NBC that the President, who actually fired the disgraced Trump foreign policy advisor in 2014, made it very clear that he is   not a fan of Michael Flynn.  NBC reports:According to all three former officials, Obama warned Trump against hiring Flynn. The Obama administration fired Flynn in 2014 from his position as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, largely because of mismanagement and temperament issues.Obama s warning pre-dated the concerns inside the government about Flynn s contacts with the Russian ambassador, one of the officials said. Obama passed along a general caution that he believed Flynn was not suitable for such a high level post, the official added.Two administration officials said Obama also warned Trump to stay vigilant on North Korea.One official says that Trump thought the remark was made  in jest,  according to NBC.Recently, Trump attempted to blame President Obama for his failure to vet Flynn.  General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration   but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,  The Donald tweeted Monday as Sally Yates was preparing to testify.But in fact, it was his team   not Obama s   who failed to vet the former General. When Flynn was fired, for example, he had not even completed a CIA background check.NEW: Flynn never received broader security clearance needed to serve as Natl Security Advisor before his firing. via @KenDilanianNBC pic.twitter.com/xDDFxtYjuW  Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) May 8, 2017Trump has a lot to be worried about right now   and more will be coming.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"May 8, 2017"
 Sally Yates Bombshell: Trump Was Warned Flynn Was Exposing White House To Blackmail (VIDEO),"Sally Yates  testimony before a congressional committee on the events leading up to Trump s disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn  resigning  and her own firing for speaking out against him had always promised to contain some explosive revelations. And it didn t take long for the match to be lit.Early into Yates  appearance in front of the committee, she got down to brass tacks. She had told Trump three separate times that Michael Flynn was trouble. In every case she was ignored, save for White House counsel demanding to know whether Flynn was facing a criminal charge. What s more, Yates testified that she has specifically told the Trump administration that there was a great deal of evidence to suggest Flynn was either susceptible to blackmail from the Russians or already compromised. Again, she was ignored and then later fired.Particularly damning, Yates said that she watched in horror as Flynn s own lies about his involvement with the Russians was being passed along to the media by others within the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence. (Pence later confirmed this by claiming he had believed what Flynn was telling him at the time.) She noted that this created a situation where the national security adviser was digging an increasingly deep hole for himself with lies and implicating everyone around him as well. She added that this was not lost on the Russians, who   given their relationship with Flynn   were holding cold, hard proof of Flynn s lies and could threaten to release it at any time.Yates:  the National Security Adviser, essentially, could be blackmailed by the Russians.   via @MSNBC pic.twitter.com/DTIAQcZ6y0  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 8, 2017It s a classic blackmail set up: Let the mark get in too deep, make sure the risk of exposure is too big a cost to bear, then use that vulnerability against him or her.Unfortunately, Trump s administration chose to stick by Flynn rather than slip out of the noose that was rapidly tightening around their necks. Making matters worse, by repeating Flynn s lies, they were also exposing themselves to blackmail. A White House run by a person famous for never apologizing to anyone in his life was walking headlong into a massive scandal   what would they do to avoid responsibility for it?As Yates put it:  You don t want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him At some point, the debate over what exactly Trump knew and when he knew it becomes moot. Even if Trump were completely blameless in the coordinated relationship between his trusted adviser and the country undermining American democracy, it would only reinforce that his stupidity qualified as criminal negligence. Obama warned him. Yates warned him. The FBI warned him. The media warned him. And he ignored all of them to protect his friend   a man now claiming to be a foreign agent.Featured image via Twitter",News,"May 8, 2017"
 Trump Hired Flynn After Obama SPECIFICALLY Warned Him Not To – Now Karma Is Coming For Trump. Hard.,"Trump s latest attempt to pass blame for his own mistakes onto others is backfiring in spectacular fashion. Like a broken record, Trump lashed out at former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who is set to testify that she emphatically warned Trump s administration about the dangers of appointing disgraced general Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. He also tried to pin the blame on Obama, justifying his hiring of Flynn on the basis of Obama having hired him during his administration   ignoring one major detail.General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration   but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017Trump thinks you re dumb enough to not realize that Obama also fired Flynn for being erratic and angry to such a degree that it disturbed his colleagues and staffers.2012 Obama appoints Flynn DIA2014 Obama fires him2016 DOD renews Flynn's clearance2016- With no apparent vetting Trump appoints him NSA https://t.co/6f0dOlpn64  Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 8, 2017However, his peculiarly fierce attacks directed at Obama over Flynn betray his Achilles heel. He is a one-trick pony   anything he is guilty of, he accuses others of being responsible for. In this case, it turns out Obama had actually warned Trump about hiring Flynn. In an Oval Office meeting just days after Trump had won the election, Obama sat him down and explained that his trusted adviser   who Trump was reportedly considering naming vice president   was unfit for office.NBC News:According to all three former officials, Obama warned Trump against hiring Flynn. The Obama administration fired Flynn in 2014 from his position as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, largely because of mismanagement and temperament issues.Obama s warning pre-dated the concerns inside the government about Flynn s contacts with the Russian ambassador, one of the officials said. Obama passed along a general caution that he believed Flynn was not suitable for such a high level post, the official added.By all accounts, Trump only got more interested in hiring Flynn after Obama s warning. Like many of his Republican brethren, Trump has long suffered from a knee-jerk reaction to do the opposite of anything Obama says. If Obama says healthcare is good, Republicans come out against it. If Obama says breathing is good, Republicans will hold their breath until they re blue in the face. And apparently if Obama says  Don t hire this unstable, incompetent nutjob to serve in one of the most important roles in the White House,  Trump fast-tracks his application.The irony, of course, is that by deliberately ignoring Obama s warning, Trump made the bed he s currently sleeping in. The fact that he tried to cover up his mistake by firing Sally Yates when she, too, warned him about Flynn only makes things worse for him. Trump is most certainly guilty of many things, but at the forefront is his own rank stupidity and creepy obsession with Obama.His ugliest traits conspired to undo him.How fitting.Featured image via Jack Gruber-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 8, 2017"
 Twitter Mocks Trump’s Face Off After Poorly-Spelled Insane Rant About Sally Yates (TWEETS),"Donald Trump kicked off his week with a ridiculous attack on former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates.Yates, of course, was fired after she refused to back Trump s first Muslim ban in court. It was, of course, later deemed unconstitutional and the administration suffered a fair amount of embarrassment from Trump s decision to fire Yates. Yates also warned The Donald about Michael Flynn, who was later fired by the administration for allegedly lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his specious contacts with Russia.

 Trump Just FAILED Hundreds Of Manufacturing Workers And Blamed Obama For It,"Last year, Trump claimed he was succeeding at saving manufacturing jobs by making individual deals with individual companies, like Carrier in Indiana. At the time, people pointed out that he was boasting about the Carrier deal while totally ignoring another Indiana company, Rexnord, that was likewise shipping its jobs to Mexico.And now, Rexnord has done so. NBC News did a report on the plant s closure, which Trump must have watched because he felt the need to lay the blame for this on Obama shortly after it aired:Rexnord of Indiana made a deal during the Obama Administration to move to Mexico. Fired their employees. Tax product big that s sold in U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2017The funny thing is that if he hadn t been bragging about how great he was at saving manufacturing jobs the instant he won the election, and threatening companies who were trying to outsource, he might actually have a case to make. But he promised to save these kinds of jobs and implied that he would do it company by company if he had to.All he did with Rexnord was tweet at them, which did nothing to sway their decision. And their employees feel as though Trump failed them. As one employee said: In the long run, he s done forgot about us  cause he s moved on to bigger and better things. Perhaps this little plant was just too little for Trump to bother with. The move will save Rexnord tens of millions of dollars, because they can pay Mexican workers $3 per hour vs. the $25 per hour they were paying their American workers. Regardless, this is what Trump said back in December, shortly after claiming victory with both Ford and Carrier:Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016To our knowledge, Trump never even tried to save these jobs despite calling this company out and threatening them with huge tariffs should they actually do this. This is on his head, not Obama s.

 Here’s The Disgusting Propaganda The White House Plans To Use To Smear Sally Yates’ Russia Testimony (DETAILS),"The world is eagerly awaiting the testimony of former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates regarding the Trump/Russia connection. Of course, we all remember how she was promptly fired for refusing to defend Donald Trump and his bigoted administration s unconstitutional Muslim ban. Afterward, it also came out that Yates warned Trump and others in the White House that then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was possibly compromised by Russian operatives. He was only fired weeks later when it came out that he lied to Mike Pence about his conversations with the Russians. Now, it seems that the White House has two goals: Smear Sally Yates as some kind of Democratic political hack, and put as much distance as they can between the Trump Administration and Michael Flynn.Now that they cannot stop Sally Yates from telling Congress everything she knows about this Russia mess, it seems that Flynn will be the one to take the fall, and despite his previous loyalty to Trump, the White House is just fine with that. Perhaps this is why Flynn previously asked for immunity so he could tell Congress what he knows. Axios reports that the Trump White House strategy to make themselves look squeaky clean in all of this when they are clearly balls deep is as follows:Of course, the point of portraying Yates as some kind of Obama holdover is to make it seem like she s making the case for Trump s impeachment and the indictment of his officials. She isn t, though. Sally Yates is a career Department of Justice lawyer who has served under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Her only loyalty is to the law.This is all just more of the Trump Administration s lies and propaganda, in order to distract from the fact that this Russia mess is getting hotter and hotter by the day. Hopefully, there is something Sally Yates has to say that will warrant a few arrests   starting in the West Wing of the White House.Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images",News,"May 7, 2017"
 Dem. Senator BLASTS Mitch McConnell For Excluding Women From Panel Drafting New Senate Health Plan,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced who he has selected to take on crafting the Senate version of the House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA), but Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) is having none of it and blasted McConnell for not putting any of the female senators in the group.Feinstein expressed her extreme displeasure with the decision to exclude women from this important panel on Meet the Press. She told Andrea Mitchell, I don t know what the 13 white men, when you have five Republican women who are excluded from that, that these 13 men are supposed to sit down and put something together. One main problem with leaving women off of this key panel is that as passed by the House, the ACHA drastically changed the way pre-existing conditions are treated. Under the Affordable Care Act, premiums could not be raised nor could coverage be denied to people with pre-existing health issues. While many of these problems can affect men and women, such as depression and acne, some only apply to women. For example, pregnancy and problems with menstruation can be considered pre-existing conditions under the House bill.Feinstein noted that women s health care has to be considered when they draft the Senate bill. As for responses to the House bill, The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and the National Physicians Alliance have all come out against the ACHA.  Feinstein added, Women s health is a big part of this, and women are a majority of the population and their health interests deserve to be contemplated in any reform. I m really very worried that in the rush to judgment, we create a major healthcare problem for people. And we lose a lot of jobs in so doing and we create a whole atmosphere of unpredictability. For an idea of what they may now consider pre-existing conditions, this is just the short list of what might force someone to pay more under Trump s plan, as passed by the House. By making it legal to charge people more for having these problems, they may not be officially barring them from getting insurance but they will make it too expensive for people to afford it.This list is not complete, but you get the gist. Barring women from any discussions relating to this new draft for the Senate is absolutely absurd and it s just one more reason why we have to keep resisting   they can t be allowed to pass this bill without every voice being heard. Call your senators now before it s too late!Featured image via Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.",News,"May 7, 2017"
 France REJECTS Far-Right Fascist In LANDSLIDE Victory For Democracy (DETAILS),"All over the western world, we have seen a wave of nationalistic, xenophobic fascism take hold in the last year or so. It is what gave Great Britain its exit from the European Union, or Brexit. It is also what gave the United States Donald Trump. However, as the rest of Europe sees the results and suffering of these tragic mistakes, the tide is turning away from fascistic nationalism and back toward democracy. The Netherlands rejected Geert Wilders, a staunchly nationalistic, far-right candidate who wanted to ban Islam outright from The Netherlands, and who was also endorsed by U.S. Congressman Steve King (R-IA), he of the infamous  somebody else s babies  tweet. The same happened in Austria, where the voters there rejected another right-wing nut. Now, France has become the latest to prove that democracy trumps fascism, as their voters rejoice in the election of centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron over far-right, anti-immigrant lunatic Marine Le Pen.This was no squeaker, either. This was firm rejection of Le Pen s fascistic, bigoted rhetoric and anti-immigrant, nationalistic policies. Macron won with 65% of the French vote, and will hopefully now go quietly into the night now that the she can clearly see that the French people did not want her craziness to become law.There is another side to this, though. Perhaps the French people are seeing what the  change  election has done to us here in America? After all, Marine Le Pen has often been referred to as the French Donald Trump. Hell, Le Pen herself has admitted that Trump s election here in America has given her legitimacy, and she was spotted at Trump Tower in New York City earlier this year. Therefore it should come as no surprise that Trump endorsed her candidacy. They are two of a kind.However, Le Pen s sound defeat should give us all hope. As Trump s disastrous presidency unfolds and his failures mount, perhaps America will come to her senses in 2020 if we happen to survive this, and reject this nationalism and xenophobia. It s the only sensible thing to do.Featured image via video screen capture from Twitter",News,"May 7, 2017"
 WATCH: Kellyanne Conway BASHES Americans Who Oppose Trumpcare: They Are Jeering From The ‘Cheap Seats’,"How is the wicked witch of the White House still allowed to talk on television?When House Republicans passed their Trumpcare bill on Thursday, they did so without reading it or getting a CBO score for it, which made it easier for them to close their eyes and vote to screw over the American people, including their own constituents.Trump s healthcare bill would strip healthcare from millions of Americans. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, 45,000 people in this country died every year due to a lack of accessible and affordable healthcare. The Trumpcare bill would repeal President Obama s signature law and put thousands of Americans at risk of dying because they can t get health insurance.But Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News on Sunday to deny that people die because of not having health insurance. In short, her attempt to defend Trump s bill was pathetic and insulting.First, she referred to Americans who oppose Trump s bill as liars jeering from the  cheap seats. Look, it s easier to jeer from the cheap seats than come up with a message of your own and be honest about the facts,  Conway said.  How did we get here? Why have so many Americans asked for Obamacare to be repealed and replaced? It s because you have premiums that have increased by 40 percent on average. And then she whined about opponents warning that the bill will kill people and accused them of using scare tactics. You know, saying people are going to die   and the enablers in the mainstream media not calling out those breathless, heartless predictions, and going right on to prognostication for 2018. Why in the world are we talking about who is going to win in 2018 when the duty of the mainstream media, of  news reporters  is to tell you what s actually in the bill, not to allow others to scare. Here s the video via YouTube.You know who is really being breathless and heartless? Kellyanne Conway.Once again, she is lying to the American people and insulting everyone who opposes Donald Trump and his downright evil agenda.It is a FACT that thousands of people died every year because they can t afford health insurance.The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, which is why Democrats have offered to work with Republicans to fix what needs to be fixed, but Republicans are so obsessed with erasing every achievement made by President Obama that they are unwilling to do so. They would rather scrap the entire law instead.The problem is that the Republican bill does not protect people with pre-existing conditions. In fact, it classifies pregnancy, PTSD, and sexual assault as pre-existing conditions that would disqualify people from getting health insurance. Furthermore, it slaps senior citizens with an age tax and puts a limit on how long insurance will cover their needs. It also makes them pay MORE for healthcare than they currently do now under the Affordable Care Act.Trump s bill would make it impossible for low-income Americans to afford health insurance, thereby sentencing them to death if they get seriously sick and can t afford care.Basically, Trump s bill really does include death panels, which, interestingly enough, was a lie that Republicans repeatedly used to scare people into opposing the Affordable Care Act. Now they are accusing Democrats of doing the same thing even though Trump s bill would repeal a law that has literally saved thousands of lives over the years. Trump s bill would end those lives.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"May 7, 2017"

 Paul Ryan Takes A Monumentally HUMILIATING Photo With A Constituent Who EXPERTLY Trolled Him (IMAGE),"Politicians are all about photo-ops. This is especially true of high-ranking, smarmy types like House Speaker Paul Ryan. However, Speaker Ryan s opportunism got the best of him during the congressional break this weekend, when he wound up taking a picture with a #RESISTANCE activist while Ryan himself was wearing an apron at a shelter of some sort and pretending to care about people.Of course, the members of Congress are taking their break amid the worst, most cruel and craven healthcare bill that has been passed in living memory, and millions of Americans are understandably upset at the prospect of the Republicans taking their healthcare away as these rich assholes celebrate in the White House Rose Garden with Donald Trump. After all, all the House GOP cares about is a win for their egotistical orange  president.  Therefore, it should come as no surprise that a  protester wearing a  Pod Save America  t-shirt that read Repeal and go f*ck yourself,  and that was signed  GOP,  took the opportunity to troll Speaker Ryan so expertly.

 MSNBC BRILLIANTLY Smacks Offended Trumpkins Who Want Colbert Fired For A Joke (VIDEO),"By now, everyone knows that Stephen Colbert laid into Donald Trump in spectacular fashion on Monday night with a tirade that culminated with the Late Show host declaring that the wannabe president s mouth isn t good for anything but serving as Russian President Vladimir Putin s  cock holster.  Now, considering all the vulgar language Trump has used and continues to use, and his cavalier attitude toward said language   and, in some cases, even actions   one would think this sort of thing would be accepted as par for the course in this administration. But, alas, common sense is scarce here, so of course Trump and his supporters are offended. Hell, even the Federal Communications Commission is trying to go after Colbert for the joke. Well, an MSNBC panel has just about had enough of the double standards and hypocrisy on this one, and they let Trump and his cronies know it on Saturday.Dean Obeidallah, Scott Blakeman and Judy Gold appeared on Saturday s edition of Joy Reid s weekend show, AM Joy, and lit into the people going after Colbert for making fun of Trump in a crude way. First, Obeidallah railed against the idea that GOP types could ever think   much less care   that joke was homophobic. He also alluded to how it is Trump who took our politics into the gutter, and therefore he is not immune to being the subject of such crude jokes: Nothing is off limits with this guy. I think comedians are playing a role in preventing him from being normalized. Too bad little snowflakes. We re going to make as many jokes as we want. You need a safe space, go hide. Put on your big boy pants because it s just beginning. Judy Gold then chimed in, reminding everyone that right-wingers bitched about Ann Coulter being too nasty to speak at Berkeley, and how right-wingers reacted to that. Either they like free speech or they don t. Gold said: The outrage that we had to listen to about Ann Coulter and her hate speech at Berkeley that the conservatives were,  Oh, you know, there s too much political correctness, too much of this and too much of that.  Colbert is a comedian. He is telling a joke. Funny is funny. This panel is correct. The Right wants to cry foul if someone shuts down one of their speakers, but they want a late night comedian fined if he says something that is a little too off color for their tastes about their great orange leader. Get used to it, conservatives. Elect a clown, expect a circus. And expect the people who realize what a clown he is to make fun of said clown and its circus.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 7, 2017"
 Multiple Sclerosis Patient Montel Williams Rips GOP Health Care Bill To Pieces: ‘So Wrong’ (VIDEO),"Montel Williams, who has been fighting Multiple Sclerosis since 1999, ripped the GOP s hideous health care bill, and the Republicans who voted for it, to pieces.The American Health Care Act guts the protections for pre-existing conditions that Obamacare had provided. Under the AHCA, states could opt out of federal regulations and allow insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions as much as they want. This means that sick people, the very people who need medical care the most, could find themselves priced out of insurance coverage.Williams, who has been a vocal advocate for MS, weighed in on the bill during an interview with CNN on Saturday. When by asked by Ana Cabrera what he thought of the AHCA, Williams did not hold back.What people at home don t understand, when you say terms and things like pre-existing conditions, they really are basing this on what an insurance company has stated was a pre-existing condition.So, they think about 22 percent of Americans have a problem right this minute. This is from the National Institutes of Health. Over 56 percent of adult Americans, 120 million adult Americans, have one chronic illness. And around 80 percent of them have at least two.So these numbers that people throw out are so wrong.Cabrera pointed out that Republicans have promised  access  to health care, but what they really mean is that you can get insurance coverage if you are rich enough to pay for it. Williams said that he is lucky to be able to afford whatever health insurance he needs, but most Americans don t have that luxury.He went on to say that many MS patients are already unable to get the medications they need to control this debilitating neurological condition because they don t have insurance. Williams explained that the medication he himself is on costs over $1,500 a month. I also have MS, and the price tag for just one of my medications tops $100,000 a year.Williams says that we need to worry about lowering costs, not signing people s death warrants with heinous bills like the AHCA. He explains that the  normal American  can t afford to pay these kinds of prices for the medicines  that keep them alive. That s what insurance is for,  he added.Watch Montel tear the GOP health care bill to pieces, here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 6, 2017"
 More Networks Join in the Boycott of New Trump Ad,"If you were not ready to give thought to anything other than politics, you are in luck as the campaign for 2020 has already begun. The Trump/Pence team has already put out its first ad, in which they decry the fake news. This has caused several of the main news networks to say they will not air the new ad.CNN, ABC and NBC has cited a graphic that shows the words  fake news  over the faces of a number of anchors. The rest of the ad is devoted to listing President Donald Trump s accomplishments over the first 100 days that he has been in the White House. The ad goes on to flame the  fake news  for not covering everything the president has done since assuming office.All networks that are not running the ad say that it is inaccurate. ABC News reported that the ad was a personal attack against the network. The reporters who were targeted by the Trump ad were Rachel Maddow, Wolf Blitzer, Andrea Mitchell, Scott Pelley and George Stephanopoulos.Trump s daughter in law weighed in. Lara Trump, Eric s wife, said,  Apparently, the mainstream media are champions of the First Amendment only when it serves their own political views.  She is working on the president s reelection efforts.The campaign is not just making misleading ads, however. They are also actively working on donations and are courting high level donors.The ad also lists the problems the campaign has seen with press coverage of the president and his team. For example, Sean Hannity did a press interview with 60 Minutes and he had a beef with the way they edited the piece. Another example of  fake news  coverage was a segment on The Rachel Maddow Show where a copy of the president s 2005 tax return.The ad will run on FOX News and the FOX Business Network.Featured image via the Trump/Pence campaign.",News,"May 6, 2017"
" In 2011, Stephen Colbert Gave Us A Futuristic View Of Trump’s Presidency; He Wasn’t Far Off (VIDEO)","Stephen Colbert came under fire from conservatives this week for a late night monologue that could best be defined as a rant against Donald Trump. It ended with Colbert saying,  The only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin s cock holster. This is far from the first time Colbert has gone after Trump. Back in 2011, when the potential to run for president was only a rumor, and when Trump was best known for propagating the birther theory about President Obama, Colbert poked fun at Trump s pointless and non-sequitur way of speaking.In the video, Colbert began by talking about a GOP presidential debate that barely anyone chose to attend. About halfway through, though, Colbert started poking fun at Trump s style of saying nothing but using a lot of words to do it. In this, Trump compared gay marriage to using a long putter (post all jokes in the comments).TRUMP: It s like in golf. A lot of people I don t want this to sound trivial but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive. It s weird. You see these great players with these really long putters, because they can t sink three-footers anymore. And, I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist.Colbert figured that that form of  logic  could be applied to other things as well, like raising the debt ceiling or Medicare. He compared it to almond butter. Medicare would be like cuff links.Here s the video:Colbert wasn t too far off at all. Trump as Oval Office Occupier continues the same sort of speaking style, often making no sense at all. The perfect example was when he was far more interested in the chocolate cake he was eating when he bombed Syria than in the bombing itself. In fact, he forgot the name of the country he bombed.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"May 6, 2017"

 Ellen DeGeneres Refuses To Have Donald Trump On Her Show; Here’s Why (VIDEO),"Ellen DeGeneres, perhaps more than anyone, has shown average Americans that LGBT people are just like other people, only in her case, a lot funnier, a better dancer and a lot nicer. She s so nice that she rarely weighs into political issues, so for liberals, it was refreshing when she told Matt Lauer of The Today Show that she would never have Trump on her show because  he s against everything that (she) stand(s) for. The daytime talkshow host has interviewed numerous politicians on her show, including Barack and Michelle Obama, Bernie Sanders and even George W. Bush. Obama even awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. But for Trump, she says,  I m not going to change his mind,  and that kills it for her. We need to look at someone else who looks different than us and believes in something that we don t believe in and still accept them, and still let them have their rights. It s not really personal for DeGeneres, who said she s met Trump and never had a problem with him until he began running for president. I flew in his helicopter and did a bit with him. So I knew him then,  she told Lauer. I have not spoken to him since he s run for president or become president,  she said.Here s the video:DeGeneres came out 20 years ago. Since then, she has gained mainstream acceptance and there s little doubt that her show and her persona have helped change Americans  views on LGBT rights.She doesn t get political too often, but this isn t the first time she has spoken out against Trump. DeGeneres was the voice of Dory in the animated Pixar film Finding Dory. After Trump s inauguration, she noted that there were similarities between Dory and Trump s proposed border wall. Now, of course Finding Dory is about a fish named Dory,  DeGeneres said in front of a monitor displaying stills from the film.

" Mike Huckabee Posts ‘Super Racist’ Cinco De Mayo Tweet, America Responds Perfectly","Ever since Donald Trump won the election, Republicans have felt they have free reign to show just how racist and despicable they can be. The party s true colors are on full display, and today s GOPers have no shame in expressing their most vile thoughts and offensive sense of humor.We saw this today when Mike Huckabee decided to celebrate Cinco de Mayo by tweeting an extremely racist message, which he obviously thought was hilarious. The problem is, no one else did.People have criticized Huckabee s jokes before, stating that they re either not funny or mean-spirited, and some are just plain confusing. In this case, Huckabee went full racist and unleashed his funny bone on Twitter.Huckabee stated that in celebration of Cinco de Mayo, he would  drink an entire jar of hot salsa , watch racist cartoons and  speak Spanish  all day. You can t get more racist than that: If you didn t think this  joke  was funny, you re not alone   tons of people on Twitter didn t enjoy it, either   and they didn t hesitate to tell him. Huckabee got dragged on Twitter, proving that America won t stand for the  values  that the Trump administration is trying to push on the country. Here are some of the best responses:      Here s our favorite, and it s probably the response that will hurt the most, because it s true!After his presidential campaign crashed and burned, coming to a pathetic end, Huckabee is struggling to stay relevant. He hopped on the Trump train for a while, and this joke explains exactly why he supported the undeserving POTUS   racists love to stick together.Hopefully, the backlash to this tweet will remind Huckabee that no one likes him and that racism is still not okay, even if we do have a racist president at the moment.Featured image via Getty Images",News,"May 5, 2017"
 Stephen Colbert Made A Joke About Trump And Now The Government Is Investigating Him,"On Monday night, Stephen Colbert was on fire. Trump went after one of Colbert s network colleagues, John Dickerson, calling the program Face the Nation, Deface the Nation. That didn t go over well with the comedian, who went on a rant against Trump. Mr. Trump, your presidency? I love your presidency. I call it Disgrace the Nation. You re not the POTUS. You re the BLOATUS. You re the glutton with the button. You re a regular Gorge Washington. You re the presi-dunce, but you re turning into a real prick-tator. Sir, you attract more skinheads than free Rogaine. You have more people marching against you than cancer. You talk like a sign language gorilla who got hit in the head. In fact, the only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin s [censored] holster. Your presidential library is going to be a kids  menu and a couple of Juggs magazines. The only thing smaller than your hands is your tax returns, and you can take that any way you want. Since then, conservatives have suddenly become the arbiter of political correctness and they suddenly give a crap about gay people, well, they care that their beloved leader had a sex joke made about him, which somehow makes Colbert homophobic. #FireColbert immediately became a trending hashtag on Twitter.I am a conservative who respects free speech. However, I will boycott you show and any sponsors of your show.

Politically correct conservative little snowflakes are taking it to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to complain and they are opening an investigation. We are going to take the facts that we find and we are going to apply the law as it s been set out by the Supreme Court and other courts and we ll take the appropriate action,  he told Talk Radio 1210 WPHT Thursday. Traditionally, the agency has to decide, if it does find a violation, what the appropriate remedy should be,  he said.  A fine, of some sort, is typically what we do. Ajit Pai, who heads the administration, is an Obama appointee but was made head of the FCC by Donald Trump, so yes, he does have a political position and it s not hard to imagine that the thin-skinned dictator wannabe is putting pressure on Pai. After all, in Trump s short history, he has already fired several people who dared disagree with, or would potentially disagree with, Der Orange F hrer.That s not to imply that Pai is corrupt. He s already given himself an out for punishing Colbert and CBS by noting that standards are different for late night TV than they are for daytime or prime time. Let s hope he maintains his integrity.Featured image via video screen capture.",News,"May 5, 2017"
" WATCH: Teacher Whitesplains His Use Of ‘N***er’ To Black Student, Fails MISERABLY (VIDEO)","Just when you think you ve seen everything, a video pops up online showing a white teacher trying to explain to a black student that it s okay to use the n-word.In Louisiana, at Ben Franklin High School, a teacher referenced as  Coach Ryan  is seen on video in a heated discussion with a black student. The student is clearly upset with the teacher and would like Coach Ryan to stop using the n-word.The teacher even went so far as to say that it s a  commoditized word  that holds no negative meaning anymore and that people need to move on from thinking that it s bad.You can hear the student say: That s racist as sh*t. Why can you not understand that it s racist for a white man to say  n***er  to a black man? It s f*cking racist. Watch the interaction here:It s unbelievable, yet unfortunately believable, that a teacher in the year 2017 would not only think that it s okay to use the n-word, but to also try to argue with a black student about it, and insist that it s not racist.The Root reports: According to the TImes-Picayune, students went to the principal s office after class with the intent of staging a sit-in that instead turned into an hourlong assembly.Videos and photos of the assembly circulated on social media, too, with a different student talking about the stigma that black people face in society. It s good that a great discussion stemmed from such a profoundly awful situation, but hopefully, that teacher has also been reprimanded for his insanely derogatory speech. When our educators are trying to educate that racism is okay, that s not okay at all.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 5, 2017"
 Trump Accidentally Says He Wants Single Payer In Latest Tweet – Twitter Lets Him Know (TWEETS),"It can easily be said that Donald Trump is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, and he just proved that fact once again with his latest tweet.Trump, since the start of his campaign, has been telling everyone that he s going to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something better, and quite honestly if his latest tweet is what he wants   liberals will likely get on board. However, in his idiocy, he probably doesn t realize what he just said.Trump tweeted out: Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do  everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great. Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do  everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great.  Donald J.

Please do!!Australia has a Medicare for all program for their citizens, and nations around the world have similar health systems that provide care for their nation s citizens. They take out the middleman of for-profit insurance, and give direct, affordable care, only increasing taxes slightly, and you no longer have the added expense of insurance premiums. AND EVERYONE IS COVERED.Now, this isn t likely what Trump meant to say, but it is what he said.The American Health Care Act, better known as Trumpcare, that passed yesterday in the House is simply a gift to the wealthy while stripping insurance and necessary benefits from those who need it most. That s NOT what Australia has, and would be far worse than anything else in the world.Twitter quickly reminded Trump that he s a moron:@realDonaldTrump Australia is part of the rest of the civilized world that has Universal HC.We can do better.#AHCA#FridayFeeling #TheResistance pic.twitter.com/X1K7f6mAg3  Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 5, 2017@realDonaldTrump And why do you think that everybody else has better healthcare than we do?

 Trump Nominee Brags That Taking Away Healthcare Will Force More Americans To Convert To Christianity,"Now we know the real reason why Republicans oppose universal healthcare.Donald Trump s Army Secretary nominee Mark Green is a Tennessee state senator who thinks healthcare is an obstacle that prevents churches from converting people to Christianity.Apparently, is people are healthy, it s a lot harder for them to be taken advantage of. The sick, on the other hand, will be desperate to feel better, and without healthcare to make them better, Green says they ll be forced to turn to God. The person who s in need   they look to the government for the answer, not God, and I think in that way government has done an injustice that s even bigger than just the creation of an entitlement welfare state,  Green said in 2015. In this setting, I ll share the story, I think it interrupts the opportunity for people to come to a saving knowledge of who God is. I see our sort of government-based assistance taking God out of the picture,  Green said.  If you look at the Gospels and you go and study the Gospels, every person who came to Christ came to Christ with a physical need. It was either hunger or a disease. People go to God because of a physical need and they walk away with a spiritual need met. In other words, Green opposes healthcare because he wants sick people to be desperate enough to convert to his religion. This is all about forcing people to accept a religious belief if they are sick instead of giving them the medical care they need. Basically, this is blackmail on a sickening level.Republicans are basically saying that sick people should have to become devout Christians first before getting the healthcare they need.On Thursday, House Republicans voted to strip healthcare from millions of Americans. The bill also fails to cover those with pre-existing conditions and gives a massive tax gift to the wealthy. One wonders if Green s beliefs figured into their morally bankrupt decision.The bottom line is that people should not have to adopt a religious belief in order to get healthcare.Such a system is cruel and further breaks down faith in religious institutions. Churches would become nothing more than prisons where the less devout and non-believers are punished by being denied real healthcare.That s not what America is all about.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"May 5, 2017"
 Trump Says He’s Going To Save the Country Money By Going Golfing Again,"The current occupant of the White House is occupying a golf course again, marking this (a three day weekend for him) his 21st visit to a golf course as  president.  Just after gutting health care for up to 24 million Americans, then throwing a kegger for Republicans who were complicit in an attack on their own constituents, Donald Trump decided to take a vacay and go golfing.This morning Trump tweeted from his social media podium,  Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money! Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2017So, after sticking a knife in the middle class and lower-income Americans by passing Trumpcare through the House, the former reality show star traipsed off to his fancy golf club which costs members $300,000 a shot. Again, that was after he gave the top 2 percent a trillion dollar tax cut while gifting the bottom 40 percent with having to pay for it with their health care. Are we tired of all this winning yet?

The former reality show star thinks being leader of the free world is a 9-5 type of gig with an extra day off for knifing the poor and middle class.During the same period of time in Barack Obama s presidency, he golfed once. One time. And Donald Trump repeatedly disparaged him for it. As of April 2nd, Trump spent nine consecutive weekends at Trump-owned properties, bringing up once more his mounting conflicts of interest.Trump was already in New York City where he could have spent time with his wife, who is totally in love with him, and their son, Barron. But, according to Trump, he didn t want to  cause a disruption.  Now far be it from us to call him a Big Old Liar, but Trump didn t remain in NYC, because everyone there hates him. And that may or may not include his wife. Who knows.It s really bad optics to screw the poor over then go golfing with wealthy people. To Trump, saving us money means costing us more money.

 FDA Department Gets Order From White House Saying All Office TVs Must Be Programmed To Fox News Only,"A little over 100 days into America s experiment in dystopian rule took a predictably sad turn: The Trump administration, apparently tired of allowing people to watch non-propaganda, have begun ordering government agencies to only allow Fox News to be played in government buildings. Fox News, of course, has operated as little more than a full-time state news agency for the Trump administration.The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), operating within the FDA, was given this message after employees asked why all of their monitors had inexplicably been changed to Fox News:I wanted to let everyone know that the reason for the change from CNN to FOX.The reason for the change is that a decision from the current administration adminstrative officials has requested that all monitors, under our control, on the White Oak Campus, display FOX news.Sorry for the inconvenience, but I am unable to change any of the monitors to any other news source at this time.Reporter Julia Reinstein confirmed the email from a source within the research center.Someone at CBER sent me the email which told staff TVs had been switched to Fox News by order of the admin pic.twitter.com/rsCzpOtdpv  Julia Reinstein (@juliareinstein) May 5, 2017Reinstein got a picture confirming that the TVs within an office filled with serious scientists and researchers trying to do their jobs really were streaming Fox News.Here's Fox News on the TVs at CBER, same day an email went out to staff saying it had been switched from CNN to Fox by order of Trump admin pic.twitter.com/uVPx8jekIk  Julia Reinstein (@juliareinstein) May 5, 2017Fox News has weathered its own scandals recently by doubling, then tripling down on unwavering support of Donald Trump. Its years of anti-Obama hysterics have given way to a Trump promotional operation that is breathtaking to watch. The mental gymnastics the network pulls in order to defend Trump s (largely unsuccessful) first 100 days has become the stuff of legend, including what may be one of the most unintentionally hilarious tweets ever published.Jobless rate after first 3 months: Trump vs. Obama vs. Bush vs. Clinton. pic.twitter.com/EUTEseJyTj  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017Unsurprisingly, all of this favorable coverage has pleased Trump, who is reportedly obsessed with what people are saying about him on cable news.

 Dumbass Alaska Lawmaker Claims Women Have Abortions For A ‘Free Trip To The City’ (VIDEO),"Generations upon generations of incest have apparently caused the gerbils operating the brain of Alaska state Representative David Eastman to go on strike. As House Republicans are directly attacking the American people with their new  Trumpcare  plan, news broke that Eastman   a lawmaker from Wasilla, Sarah Palin s neck of th1e woods   decided to make the GOP sound even more heartless and stupid than they previously seemed.Eastman, who views the elimination of a clump of cells as  the ultimate form of child abuse,  recently tacked an anti-abortion message onto a state House resolution meant to raise awareness about sexual assault and child abuse   a message he says could not possibly be delivered without badgering people about abortion. Abortion is a very serious issue, and it needs to be talked about,  Eastman says, adding that women get pregnant just so they can get a  free trip to the city  for their glamorous abortion: We have folks who try to get pregnant in this state so that they can get a free trip to the city, and we have folks who want to carry their baby past the point of being able to have an abortion in this state so that they can have a free trip to Seattle. Medicaid can fund a woman s travel to Anchorage or Seattle if they seek an abortion. Asked for evidence that women get pregnant just to take advantage of the free travel   a nonsensical claim   Eastman said that a number of people have come to (his) office with stories, experiences.  He offered no evidence to back the claim.This isn t the first horrible thing Eastman has done or said. KTUU notes that he recently was the only person to vote against resolutions honoring black soldiers who helped build the Alaska Highway during World War II and another honoring Hmong and Lao veterans who fought for the U.S. during the Vietnam War.

 Rape Can Be Considered A Pre-Existing Condition Under GOP Healthcare Law,"House Republicans managed to pass their healthcare bill on Thursday, just barely, and it is truly a despicable piece of legislation. The right-wing nutjobs who have taken over the Republican party, AKA the Freedom Caucus, refused to vote in favor of the bill as long as Obamacare s protections for pre-existing conditions remained intact. So, the GOP said the hell with it and gutted protections for the sick in order to gain their votes.Think it can t get any worse? WRONG. As if taking health care from 24 million people and removing protections for pre-existing conditions isn t bad enough, what qualifies as a pre-existing condition is even worse.Among possible pre-existing conditions that could result in outrageous premiums are rape and sexual assault. Seriously. Rape.NYMag reports:The new MacArthur-Meadows Amendment will allow states to discriminate based on medical history, reportedly without addressing the subsequent high cost of health care for millions of Americans.In addition to rape, postpartum depression, cesarean sections, and surviving domestic violence are all considered preexisting conditions. Companies can also deny coverage for gynecological services and mammograms.The amendment also says that Nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to discriminate in rates for health insurance coverage by gender.  But, ummm, did you look at what qualifies as a pre-existing condition? Insurance companies don t have to cover  gynecological services and mammograms  that screen for cancer? How many men are gonna need a c-section? How many men have postpartum depression? How many men need a pap smear to check for cervical cancer? Seems pretty damn obvious that being a woman is a pre-existing condition itself.Paul Ryan and Donald Trump have tried to claim that pre-existing conditions are covered, but that isn t exactly the truth. The MacArthur-Meadows amendment  would allow states to opt out of federal regulations and allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums for people who have pre-existing conditions. Since this was the law of the land before the Affordable Care Act, we know what happens when you give insurance companies this option: they set premiums so high that sick people are priced out of insurance coverage altogether.So now, besides the shame, fear, and trauma that have traditionally kept women from seeking medical care after they are sexually assaulted, rape victims now get to worry that they will lose their health insurance if they get help. What the actual f*ck is wrong with these people? This is as disgusting as it gets.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2017"
 Bernie Bursts Out Laughing After Trump Unknowingly Praises Australia’s Universal Health Care (VIDEO),"Hours after helping begin to repeal America s universal health care system, Trump was in New York smiling and posing for the cameras as he sat next to the Australian Prime Minister. Then he opened his mouth.In a surreal reminder of just how oblivious Trump is, the president who had spent months pushing for Congress to strip access to medical care away from Americans turned to the Australian PM and remarked that Australia has a much better health care system than the United States. We have a failing health care. I shouldn t say this to the great gentleman and my friend from Australia because you have better health care than we do. Like many developed nations, Australia has universal health care for all citizens. They have  better health care than we do  in large part because Republicans spend so much time and energy ensuring many Americans can t get access to insurance.

 American Medical Association Eviscerates GOP For Snatching Healthcare Away From Millions,"House Republicans voted on Thursday to rip healthcare away from millions of Americans. Among those who are slamming the GOP for this despicable act are doctors, who know just how bad this will be for their patients.Following the passage of the American Health Care Act, the American Medical Association issued a scathing statement. The AMA, which is the largest group of its kind in the U.S. and represents more than 20,000 physicians, slammed the bill for leaving millions without access to medical care. The bill passed by the House today will result in millions of Americans losing access to quality, affordable health insurance and those with pre-existing health conditions face the possibility of going back to the time when insurers could charge them premiums that made access to coverage out of the question,  AMA President Andrew Gurman said.The group conceded that action is needed to improve the current health care insurance system.  After all, no one has ever claimed that Obamacare was perfect. However, the GOP s bill is not the answer we need. The AMA urged the White House and  the Senate to work toward  bipartisan solutions. The AMA urges the Senate and the Administration to work with physician, patient, hospital and other provider groups to craft bipartisan solutions so all American families can access affordable and meaningful coverage, while preserving the safety net for vulnerable populations,  he said.The CBO has estimated that 24 million people will lose their healthcare coverage under the Republican plan. The elderly and sick (you know, the people who need medical care the most) will be hit the hardest by the GOP bill. Under the AHCA, states will be able to gut protections for pre-existing conditions and tell insurance companies that they can charge sick people as much as they want, even if that means these people are priced out of coverage altogether.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2017"
 Ex-GOP Congressman Might As Well Be Wearing A Hood During Latest Interview (VIDEO),"The depths of Republican cruelty is on full display this week after the House passed the disastrous unread/unscored bill that we will forever call Trumpcare. It seems though, that even some Republicans are admitting that single payer or at least some form of actual universal healthcare is ideal, but, at least according to ex-congressman and deadbeat dad Joe Walsh, we can t have nice things because we have black people.Walsh, who for some unfathomable reason, is an MSNBC contributor, sparred with host Ali Velshi, who told the ex-congressman that our healthcare system ranks last among the 11 wealthiest nations. All the others have universal healthcare. That s when things turned ugly. You can t compare the rest of the world to us,  Walsh replied.  They do not have the big diverse populations that we have. They do not have the inner-city populations that we have. Later, when Velshi brought up the point again   that the United States ranks poorly in life expectancy, access to care and a variety of other measures   Walsh again brought up diversity. I love you, my friend, but you cannot   Sweden does not have our inner-city population,  he said.  Norway, these countries do not have   you re talking about countries the size of India with homogenous populations, Ali. You can t compare them to what we have! Source: Talking Points MemoVelshi, to his credit, didn t back down. He mentioned Canada, which is actually more ethnically diverse than the United States and has better health care.Here s the video:Walsh, of course, has the entire issue completely backwards. Yes, people of color, and in particular African-Americans and Hispanics, do have a lower life expectancy, although that is improving. But that s not because they are black, as Walsh implies. It s because they are more likely to live in poverty and they are less likely to have insurance.While a plurality (45%) of the uninsured are non-Hispanic Whites, people of color are at higher risk of being uninsured than Whites. People of color make up 41% of the nonelderly U.S. population but account for over half of the total nonelderly uninsured population (Figure 4). The disparity in insurance coverage is especially high for Hispanics, who account for 20% of the nonelderly population but nearly a third (32%) of the nonelderly uninsured population. Hispanics and Blacks have significantly higher uninsured rates (17.2% and 12.2%, respectively) than Whites (8.1%).Source: KFF.orgInstead of addressing poverty and lack of healthcare availability, Republicans like Walsh would rather use this totally fixable disparity to deepen the racial divide in this country and to foster hate. As for Walsh, he might as well wear that hood you know he owns in public. He s not even pretending anymore.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2017"

On Thursday, for the second time in his short presidency, Donald Trump screwed over the Australian Prime Minister   all so he could celebrate the House s healthcare vote.The weird feud (for lack of a better word) began very soon after Trump took office. Trump hung up on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a dispute about refugees after bragging about his win. Trump called the call, which was reportedly his fourth with a world leader that day,  the worst call by far. It got worse on Thursday when Trump and the Prime Minister were supposed to hash out, or at least cool their differences. You can bet that Turnbull is feeling anything but warm toward the United States after Trump once again snubbed him, just so he could celebrate half a legislative victory.The White House had initially set aside a chunk of time early Thursday evening for the two leaders to hold a bilateral meeting ahead of their joint commemoration of the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea at a dinner later that night.Instead, Trump is now scheduled to spend 30 minutes with Turnbull ahead of the ceremony, according to an updated schedule released by the White House.Source: Washington PostThis insult was on top of the fact that Trump was already treating Turnbull like a second class leader. Trump hosts most foreign leaders in Washington or at Mar-a-Lago, where they are treated like royalty. The meeting with Turnbull, even in its planned form, was going to be held at the Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan, with little fanfare.Australia, of course, is treating the incident with far more class than they ve been shown by Trump. The delegation does not feel snubbed at all,  said a senior Australian official.  It certainly understands the significant legislative achievement. The program was always on the understanding of fluidity. It s doubtful they re that understanding. They, after all, come from a country that cares about its people s health. Plus, this was only half a victory. The disastrous TrumpCare still needs to pass the Senate.Featured image via Cameron Spencer/Getty Images and Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2017"
" Democrats Chant Warning To GOP As Trumpcare Passes: Na Na Na Na, Hey Hey Hey, Goodbye! (VIDEO)","Alleged president Donald Trump is throwing a party for House Republicans after passing the worst healthcare plan imaginable to replace Obamacare while sticking a knife in the back of the middle class. Republicans had eight years to come up with a viable alternative, but instead, the ACHA will raise pregnancy costs by 425 percent, and the top two percent will be gifted with a trillion dollar tax cut and that will be paid for by the bottom 40 percent. Fiscally conservative Republicans don t seem to care what Trumpcare will cost the taxpayers. They refused to wait for the CBO scores to find out.Twenty Republicans in total broke with their party and voted against the bill which will strip health care from 24 million Americans.Democrats had a message for House Republicans who voted to let this travesty of a health care plan pass. They taunted Republicans by chanting,  Na na na na, Na na na na, Hey hey hey, Goodbye!

The elderly, people with cancer, diabetes, asthma, etc, will see a surge in their premiums. Having healthcare will no longer be affordable. Obamacare had issues but it was fixable and those with pre-existing conditions were covered.Trump supporters will be largely affected by the repeal of Obamacare and some of them are waking up to that inconvenient fact.I voted for Trump, dear god I wish I could take my vote back.

 Leading Senator In Trump-Russia Investigation Reveals STARTLING Odds For Trump’s Impeachment,"Ever since Donald Trump won the election (unfairly, with the help of Russia), Americans have been calling for his removal from office. These pleas have only gotten louder as Trump s presidency went on, as the incompetent POTUS repeatedly proves that he cannot do his job properly and is a danger to the country (and world).Now that Trump has passed his first 100 days, the calls for his impeachment couldn t be clearer. He s proven that he can t get anything done and wants to play golf instead. He s involved in numerous probes regarding his Russia scandal and business conflicts. Amid the controversies and a historically low approval rating, even GOP lawmakers are abandoning Trump at record speed   and many are calling for impeachment or for invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows presidents who are mentally unfit to be replaced. Some lawmakers have even said Trump isn t going to finish his first term.Stephen Moore, a senior economist at the Heritage Foundation and Trump campaign adviser, commented on Trump s plummeting approval rating in an interview with the New Yorker: You can t govern this country with a forty-per-cent approval rate   you just can t. Nobody in either party is going to bend over backwards for Trump if over half the country doesn t approve of him. That, to me, should be a big warning sign. Jerry Taylor, president of the libertarian Niskanen Center, also weighed in on why Trump s presidency is failing so quickly: The reality is, he is governing as if he is the president of a Third World country. Power is held by family and incompetent loyalists whose main calling card is the fact that Donald Trump can trust them, not whether they have any expertise. My guess is that there s only between 50 and 100 Republican members of the House that are truly enthusiastic about Donald Trump as president. The balance sees him as somewhere between a deep and dangerous embarrassment and a threat to the Constitution. Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has even predicted Trump s odds for impeachment as a striking 2-1.Professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School Laurence Tribe said that it s entirely possible that we will invoke the 25th Amendment  well before 2020 , and that it s not a  liberal fantasy  but instead can be  an entirely plausible tool    especially in Trump s case. At this point, getting Trump impeached would be a blessing.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2017"
 ‘Cases Upon Cases Of Beer’: GOP Organizes Booze Party To Celebrate Stripping 24 Million Of Insurance,"Republicans haven t read their own bill, aren t waiting around to see it independently scored, and seem to have only a limited interest in what the devastating effects may be, but they do know one thing: After they vote to strip an estimated 24 million people of health insurance and bankrupt countless more they plan to get hammered.Paul Ryan once inexplicably boasted that he d been fantasizing about killing Medicaid since he was  drinking at a keg  in college. Now on the verge of destroying America s healthcare system more completely than Fratboy Ryan ever dared dream, he seems to be channeling that same impulse. Although going on a booze bender hours after signing the literal death warrants for many Americans tends to look pretty bad, which is why Republicans tried to hide the beers under a sheet. It didn t work.Cases upon cases of beer just rolled into the Capitol on a cart covered in a sheet. Spotted Bud Light peeking out from the sheet  Alexandra Jaffe (@ajjaffe) May 4, 2017Even Roman Emperor Nero had enough sense not to be seen pounding Bud Light while the city burned.Speaking of historically bad world leaders, the White House is said to be hosting a party for Republicans to celebrate tonight:Beer being rolled into the Capitol   & @LACaldwellDC reports that Republicans will also head to White House for a congratulatory celebration https://t.co/cAC3r5eVdJ  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) May 4, 2017Other Republicans were in an equally celebratory mood   and equally tasteless. While congressional aides trickled into the Capitol building, someone started blasting the theme from  Rocky.  (The fact that Rocky actually doesn t win the fight at the end of the movie was lost on the Republicans in the room. Handshakes, smiles, and high fives were going around.)The celebratory way in which Republicans are treating this bill is in stark contrast to reality. The AHCA will almost surely mean millions lose health insurance. Those Americans with so-called  pre-existing conditions  can expect to either completely lose their coverage or find it so expensive that they may have no choice but to go without. A brand new study found that the ACA cut personal bankruptcies in the United States by half   that progress will be erased.Politically, the bill, likely represents suicide for many Republicans. As statistician Nate Silver pointed out, Obamacare was divisive and unpopular when it first passed, but this bill is really, really unpopular   orders of magnitude more so than the ACA. And unlike the ACA, the Republican plan doesn t have the benefit of actually working once it s passed. People won t even be able to  grow to like it  because   as the CBO score on the initial bill found   the legislation is a dumpster fire.All of this to say: Drink up, Republicans! Something tells me your hangover is going to last a while.Featured image via Eric Thayer/Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2017"

WATCH: Democratic Rep Delivers Scathing Rebuke Of Trumpcare Bill To Thunderous Applause On House Floor






","Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern brought the House down with a scathing rebuke of the pathetic Republican healthcare bill on Tuesday.He began by pointing out that the bill destroys all of the good things that the Affordable Care Act provides, such as covering preexisting conditions and allowing kids to stay on their parents  insurance until the age of 26.McGovern conceded that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is not perfect. It has some issues that can be fixed, and Democrats have repeatedly offered to work with Republicans to fix the problems and cover more people while also bringing down costs.But as McGovern noted, Republicans are only obsessed with repealing the law. They have no interest in fixing the minor problems, many of which they created themselves by chipping away at the law over the years.So far, the Republican bill touted by Trump has failed several times in the House because even many Republicans are concerned about the fact that repealing the Affordable Care Act would strip healthcare away from millions of Americans, including their own constituents.For months, Republicans have been torn a new one by their constituents at town halls over their effort to repeal what has become a very popular law. It is even more popular than Donald Trump now.In their continued effort to sell the bill to the American people, Trump and House Republicans have been insisting that it covers pre-existing conditions. But that is a complete lie.Nowhere in the Trumpcare bill will you find a passage making it clear that people with pre-existing conditions won t lose their insurance. It s just not there.McGovern called out Republicans for this lie on the House floor. To claim or to imply that the Republican plan covers people with preexisting conditions, it is a lie,  McGovern declared. It is a lie. And let s be honest about it. This does not cover people with preexisting conditions. And to come on the floor and say it does, to try to fool people, well, you may get away with it in the short term, you may get a headline but I tell you people will figure out soon enough when they are denied health care coverage. Furthermore, Republicans refuse to get a CBO score for the bill before holding a vote because they know it will get a failing grade.For one thing, the bill would be a massive tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of the millions of Americans who finally got healthcare coverage through the Medicaid expansion.McGovern shamed Republicans for this. You should be ashamed,  McGovern said.  To have a health care bill that cuts Medicaid by $880 billion so you can give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in this country, you should be ashamed. He then called upon Republicans to vote against the bill or pull it entirely and received a standing ovation.Here s the video via YouTube.If Trump and Republicans have their way, millions of Americans will suffer so that wealthy assholes can get even richer. That s outrageous.But even more outrageous is the fact that while the American people will lose the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, Republicans have exempted themselves from losing the same benefits the law provides.That s right. Republicans are literally making sure that they get to keep their Obamacare. That makes them heartless and selfish as well as hypocrites. They should not only be ashamed, they should be booted out of office.Featured image screenshot",News,"May 4, 2017"
 Bombshell Reports Confirm What We Already Believed About MSNBC’s Joe And Mika (DETAILS),"For the last ten years, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski have been co-hosts on MSNBC s Morning Joe. They have often seemed a little too chummy, and it has long been speculated that the two were an item. However, both were also married to other people. Scarborough got divorced from his wife in 2013, and Brzezinki was officially free in 2016. To that end, it seems that now that we are in 2017, a respectable enough amount of time has passed to where they can go ahead and confirm the public s belief that they were more than co-hosts.It is now being reported that the two are not only an item, but are actually engaged to be married. This comes after a bizarre round of  congratulations  on the Thursday edition of the show. Of course, the duo s guests said the congratulatory sentiments were about  ratings,  but now we know that it was about upcoming nuptials. The news comes courtesy of the New York Post s Emily Smith, who writes: We re told Scarborough, 54, got down on one knee and proposed at the scenic Bar Bellini at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, which has a breathtaking moonlit outdoor terrace overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. Now, think what you want of Mika and Joe   I personally have mixed feelings and a bit of a love/hate relationship with Morning Joe   but at least they are finally being honest with the public and their fans. It could be just a bit scandalous, because if they are engaged so soon after Mika s divorce, obviously there was an affair happening while either one or both of them were still married.Of course, these days scandalous affairs are pretty routine for celebrities, though they are supposedly news people   or, at the very least, pundits   so who knows how the network will handle it.There have been no public statements on the announcement from Joe, Mika, or MSNBC as of this writing.Featured image via Frederick M.

 People Can Stop Giving Obama S*it About His Speaking Fee; Here’s What He’s Doing With It,"Our White House is currently occupied by someone who s likely certifiably insane, yet for many on both the right and the left, the real travesty is that Trump s predecessor is *gasp* earning a lot of money in speaking fees, just like just about every white male former president in the last 40 years.The news that former President Barack Obama will reportedly accept $400,000 to give a speech to Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald has inspired a strange paroxysm of rage from writers on the center-left.  Obama s $400,000 Wall Street speaking fee will undermine everything he believes in,  Vox s Matt Yglesias proclaimed. Obama and Bill Clinton biographer David Maraniss said the 44th president  does not need the money and should not accept it.  Others noted the unseemliness of the fee at a time of income inequality and seemingly rampant populism, especially since Barack and Michelle Obama have already struck insanely lucrative book deals.Even Elizabeth Warren was  troubled  by Obama s speaking fees. Bernie Sanders called the fees  distasteful. Well, everyone can relax now. On Wednesday it was announced that the Obamas would be giving that amount and far more to help youth in Obama s adopted hometown of Chicago. One of the things that we ll be starting this year is Michelle and I are personally going to donate $2 million to our summer jobs programs here in the community,  he said at the South Shore Cultural Center.  [It s] so that right away young people can get to work and we can start providing opportunities to all of them. Obama is expected to use the center as he focuses on issues such as criminal justice reform and education for underprivileged children now that he has left office. Social media was quick to notice that the Obamas are literally donating five times what he will earn for that one speaking fee.THIS is President Obama. Compassion & class. FIVE times his speaking fee.

 Ben Carson: Homeless Shelters Shouldn’t Be “Comfortable” Because People Might “Stay”,"If you didn t know that Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was once a neurosurgeon, you would never believe he had any hint of intelligence just from the idiotic things he says.Today, Ben Carson was quoted in a New York Times interview painting an extremely solemn picture of what public housing will look like under the Trump administration. As Carson has said several ridiculous things during his own failed presidential campaign and while he was helping with Trump s campaign, this should hardly be surprising   but it will still infuriate you.Carson defended disabled and elderly people who might need public housing, and said we can t expect to do a great deal to take care of themselves.  But when it came to others who did not fall into those two categories but still needed public housing, Carson had something else to say. He said: There is another group of people who are able-bodied individuals, and I think we do those people a great disservice when we simply maintain them. The Times reported:Compassion, Mr. Carson explained in an interview, means not giving people  a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say:  I ll just stay here. They will take care of me. It s safe to say that most of us have been taught a VERY different meaning of the word  compassion , and Carson s definition clearly does not fit. Carson has been traveling all over the United States to get a scope of public housing in places like Detroit and Miami. While he was in Ohio, Carson visited a facility for drug abusers and reportedly said: We are talking about incentivizing those who help themselves. Carson s attitude toward public housing is disgraceful, and ABC s Sunny Hostin was right to slam him immediately:Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"May 3, 2017"
 Sh*t Just Got Real: FBI Looking Into Whether Agents Leaked Info To Giuliani During Campaign,"FBI Director James Comey said during a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing that he was looking into whether agents at the bureau leaked sensitive information to reporters or public figures, including close Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, during the 2016 presidential election.The highly anticipated hearing was revealing.During a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) asked about former FBI official Jim Kallstrom s and Giuliani s claims that they had inside information about the bureau s probe into Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server. Now either they re lying or there is a serious problem within the bureau,  Leahy said.  Did anybody in the FBI during this 2016 campaign have contact with Rudy Giuliani about the Clinton investigation? I don t know yet, but if I find out that people were leaking information about our investigations whether to reporters or private parties, there will be severe consequences,  Comey said.Comey went on to say that he was  very, very interested  in getting to the bottom of the matter and that once the FBI did so, he would inform the committee.Last October, the former New York City mayor and Trump adviser, hinted at the FBI s reopening of its email investigation into Clinton during an appearance on Fox & Friends October 25. People speculated that Giuliani appeared to have an inside contact with the agency who was giving him information.Giuliani said the Trump campaign had  a couple of surprises left , and said that further  revelations  were coming.The very next day Giuliani told Fox s Martha MacCallum that there was  a surprise or two that you re going to hear about in the next two days.  The former mayor and Trump surrogate also claimed to be in contact with numerous FBI officials, then later, he backpedaled that remark, saying that his sources were all former agents.However, during multiple cable news interviews before the election, Giuliani bragged that former agents had clued him into the  revolution coming on in the FBI  in regards to how the probe into Clinton s email server was handled.During the hearing, Comey also slammed Wikileaks as  intelligence porn.  The FBI director went on to call Russia  the greatest threat of any nation on earth, given their intention and capability,  to U.S. political systems.By the way, has anyone seen Rudy Giuliani lately? He has suddenly disappeared from cable news. Weird, huh? It s almost as if he knows a storm is coming.Next week it will be Sally Yates O Clock and she will testify about Michael Flynn.This is what we call karma and it s spelled,  ha ha ha ha ha ha haaa!

In a 2014 Facebook post, Feiglin said that Palestinians should be  concentrated  in  tent encampments  and the  formerly populated areas  to be  shelled with maximum fire power.  Any  nests of resistance  would then be  exterminated  in the  event that any should remain. Any civilians who are later allowed to stay in the area  will be required to publicly sign a declaration of loyalty to Israel, and receive a blue ID card similar to that of the Arabs of East Jerusalem. And, of course, similar to the special little badges Adolf Hitler made Jews wear. With leadership like this, how can the Palestinians not want to cozy up to Israel, right?

 Comey Just Laid Out The Two Reasons Putin Supported Trump Over Clinton And Both Are Damning (VIDEO),"Today, FBI Director James Comey sat down with Congress to talk on a wide range of scandals plaguing the Trump administration. It was Part One of a two part series of testimonies likely to destroy Trump s chances of ever pretending Russia didn t help him get elected or that he didn t know the people he staffed in the White House were rife with conflicts of interests. (Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates is up next, and it promises to be a doozy!)Comey started off by emphatically stating (again) that the intelligence community has clear evidence linking Russia   and Russia specifically   to interference with the election. Calling Russia the single biggest threat to American democracy, he didn t mince words. He also denied Trump s latest frantic attempt to cast doubt by debunking the White House s claim that it was probably China. Comey stood by the intelligence community s conclusions: This was Russia.But Comey s most powerful moment came when he was asked by Sen. Al Franken to explain why Russia wanted Trump over Hillary Clinton in the first place. What was the point? He wasn t Hillary Clinton, who Putin hated and wanted to harm in any possible way,  Comey says on why Russia had a preference for Trump pic.twitter.com/xYCQoTJhnG  CBS News (@CBSNews) May 3, 2017The point, according to Comey, was two-fold. By every shred of information the intel community has, it s clear that Russia s autocratic ruler Vladimir Putin despises Hillary Clinton. He s had a beef with her stretching back to her time as Secretary of State where she routinely stood up to his plans of expansion. He also blamed her State Department for stirring up Democratic protests against him by the Russian youth fed up with Putin s iron-grip on their country. (Like Trump, Putin often blames legitimate protests against his rule as caused by outside agitators.) In short, according to Comey, Putin wanted vengeance against Clinton for being tough on him and Trump was the way to do it.It also ties into Comey s second conclusion: Russia figured Trump, ignorant as he is, would be much easier to pull one over on. Comey put it slightly more generously: Putin believed he would be more able to make deals, reach agreements with someone with a business background than someone who had grown up in more of a government environment. Putin wasn t wrong. Before the election was even over, his campaign was secretly promising Putin that they would ease up on sanctions. Trump would later appoint Rex Tillerson, a man with very close ties to Russian oil companies and Putin himself, to Secretary of State. Russia got nearly everything they wanted on November 8th, 2016.None of this is good news for Trump. Having lost the popular vote by millions, Trump also has the distinction of being the least popular new president in history. He has a credibility problem. Comey s testimony only makes it clear that his illegitimacy problem extends internationally. Whether he coordinated with Russia intentionally or whether he was a useful stooge for Putin to exploit, remains to be seen. What is clear is that the FBI has every reason to believe Russia was celebrating Trump s win as hard as any  Make America Great Again  Trump voter.And Sally Yates has the second in the one-two punch coming next week.Featured image via CBS",News,"May 3, 2017"
 Melania Just Liked A Tweet That Shows Just How Much She Hates Her Husband (DETAILS),"There has long been speculation that Melania Trump cannot stand her husband. After all, Donald Trump is a bloviating, compulsive bully. If he bullies the rest of the world, chances are he does the same to his wife. What s to stop him? He likely controls her money and her access to her son. If she tried to speak out against him or leave him, she d lose both. Hell, he might even be able to get her deported.There s plenty of evidence out there that Melania is terrified of The Donald, but it seems she may be getting bolder. There is, thus far, absolutely no sign that she and her son, Barron, are planning to move to the White House. The only time we see them is at a few photo-ops, and when the family travels to Mar-a-Lago. She never says a word to the press, and has not executed any of the usual duties of a First Lady. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that Melania s official Twitter account liked a tweet that mocks Trump s border wall plan, saying that the only wall he s been able to build is between himself and his wife. Here is a screenshot of that particular like, in case someone pulls it down:Now, this is a pretty bold move for Melania, and kudos to her or whoever had the guts to do it. As much as Trump is on Twitter, it s likely he d see it, especially as it gets spread around the interwebs. Hopefully, he s too busy attacking political opponents, the free press, and anyone else who dares to criticize him to attack his own wife. Then again, knowing Trump, he won t be able to restrain himself.Melania, I hope you ve got good security after this one.

 Heartless Former GOP Lawmaker Had The Most DESPICABLE Response To Jimmy Kimmel’s Emotional Healthcare Plea,"Former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh (R-Ill) has always been an asshole. His Twitter feed is full of damn near sociopathic rants, and he regularly appears on television saying the same sorts of things.

However, what this guy did this time really takes the cake.By now, we ve all heard late night host Jimmy Kimmel s emotional story about his newborn son s congenital heart defect.

SnohoMo (@SnohoMo) April 29, 2017It s entirely possible that Kushner chose this new look to impress his father-in-law, although he was made the de facto president with his old hair, so he had clearly already made the right impression.More likely, this hairdo was Trump s doing. Despite the fact that Trump is a one man What Not to Wear (ties too long, suits too big and that hair!), #45 is obsessed with what everyone around him wears. Kushner s monstrosity reportedly came courtesy of Trump s  stylist  which is located across the street from Trump s New York residence. It s not tough to imagine him telling Kushner to get  the Trump. On a subconscious level, though, this hair style speaks to more than just trying to suck up to the boss. It s about a full makeover, which with Kushner, includes his principles.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"May 2, 2017"
 Madeleine Albright: Trump Needs To Stay The F*ck Away From Kim Jong Un (VIDEO),"Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright weighed in on Donald Trump s remarks about what a brilliant leader he thinks Kim Jong Un is, including his comment that he would be ever so  honored  to meet with him. Her take on the situation is that Trump needs to stay the hell away from the North Korean dictator. Far, far away. A president doesn t go to a country without any preparation, and  honored  would definitely be the wrong way to discuss somebody who is keeping his people in poverty and starving and control,  Albright told CNN s Jake Tapper on Tuesday.Trump has repeatedly gushed about how much he loves various autocrats from around the world and recently he has been singing the praises of Kim Jong Un. On Sunday, he said on CBS  Face The Nation that the murderous leader was a  smart cookie,  you know, for killing off family members to stay in power and other fun stuff like that. Then, on Monday, Trump told Bloomberg that he would be  honored  to meet with Kim Jong Un if the  circumstances  happened to be right.Albright slammed Trump for kissing up to dictators, especially the likes of Kim Jong Un. I think that part of the issue is that President Trump seems to believe that he can have just one-on-one relationships. And maybe that s possible in business, but that is not something that is possible as president of the United States,  she said.  This is not a matter of charming, by saying you re  honored  and he s a  smart cookie.' The former secretary of state has spoken out against Trump and his piss poor excuse for foreign policy from the very beginning of his candidacy. Tuesday s comments come amid rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea over Pyongyang s weapons program.You can watch Albright s entire interview here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 2, 2017"

Sean? Hey, Sean, come on! What about the Putin call, Sean?  The caption under their photo reads,  It just like concluded. The Root had its own take: Perhaps Spicer needed some time to compose the  alternative facts  he knew he d have to present after Salmon-Skin Stalin said Tuesday that the new budget has enough money for a down payment on the wall, and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Senate Appropriations Committee s ranking Democratic member, responded on Twitter with,  To be clear, there is NO funding in this bill for ANY kind of down payment on construction of a new border wall. Or, maybe Spicer was nervous about responding to Trump s tweets from earlier Tuesday insisting that the government needed a  good shutdown.' While some blindly loyal Trump supporters are saying that he just owned the press, unfortunately for their narrative and for Spicey here, answering questions he doesn t necessarily like or want to answer is part and parcel of his job. He doesn t get to run away when he doesn t want to talk, or without explaining that his time is getting cut short for something else. Really, Spicer just got owned here.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"May 2, 2017"

 Trump Mocked For Inventing Fake Civil War Battle On His Golf Course – There’s A Plaque And Everything (TWEETS),"Frederick Douglass and Andrew Jackson will be very disappointed in Donald Trump when they learn he fibbed a teensy bit about a Civil War battle he says happened on one of his golf courses. According to a plaque   yes, a plaque   Trump proudly displays at the  Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, the length of the Potomac River that borders his course is called the River of Blood because both Union and Southern soldiers died en masse between the 14th and 15th holes. The  FAILING  New York Times reported in 2015:Between the 14th hole and the 15th tee of one of the club s two courses, Mr. Trump installed a flagpole on a stone pedestal overlooking the Potomac, to which he affixed a plaque purportedly designating  The River of Blood. Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot,  the inscription reads.  The casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as  The River of Blood. The inscription, beneath his family crest and above Mr. Trump s full name, concludes:  It is my great honor to have preserved this important section of the Potomac River! The site does have historical significance alongside the Bowling Green Massacre, in that its historical significance is completely made up. No. Uh-uh. No way. Nothing like that ever happened there,  said Richard Gillespie, executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association, said of Trump s claim. Gillespie added that the only thing  close to  that was the  Battle of Ball s Bluff in 1861 in which several hundred Union solders were killed. It happened 11 miles upriver, nowhere near the  River of Blood. Called on his lie, Trump attempted to salvage his story by explaining: That was a prime site for river crossings. So, if people are crossing the river, and you happen to be in a civil war, I would say that people were shot   a lot of them. Historians say that literally no one has ever died in that crossing, but Trump complains that someone might have died at some point. How would they know that?  Trump said angrily after learning that historians say his stupid plaque is FAKE NEWS.  Were they there?  Trump says  numerous historians  have confirmed the  River of Blood.  He did not know any of their names. Embarrassingly for Trump, even Golf Digest took the time to debunk the blood river.Sadly, this is not the first mass killing invented by the Trump Administration. With the Bowling Green Massacre, the Atlanta massacre, and that thing that happened in Sweden and now the  River of Blood,  it seems that we may not be able to trust this administration, shockingly. Naturally, the Internet finds this news hilarious:.@GolfDigest Making up a battle named ""The River of Blood"" is creeeeeeeepy. #creepyoldpresidentmakingupbattles very creeeeeeeeeeeepy  Mr.Quagmire (@Mr_Quagmire_USA) May 2, 2017#TrumpTeachesHistory by commemorating a fictional battle, ""The River of Blood,"" yeah well, didn't happen  #TuesdayThoughts https://t.co/GjdtaKi6Os  Atoz ?

 CNN Refuses To Air Trump’s First 100 Days Ad For One Very Good Reason – See For Yourself (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s self-congratulatory ad to celebrate his first 100 days in the White House is gross enough to make you want to shudder and vomit. It s full of Trump s  accomplishments  (there aren t many) and portray Trump in a light that is clearly not in line with his true character and behavior.If you ve been fortunate enough not to see this ad yet, you can watch it below if you want to ruin your whole day:One network has already rejected the ad and refused to air it. After CNN reviewed the ad, they decided not to accept it because of the way Trump s team portrayed the media as  fake news. And as usual, Trump s team responded in the most childish way. In a statement on Trump s campaign website, titled: Fake News Station Refuses to Run Ad Highlighting the President s First 100 Days , his team wrote this: It is absolutely shameful to see the media blocking the positive message that President Trump is trying to share with the country. It s clear that CNN is trying to silence our voice and censor our free speech because it doesn t fit their narrative,  said Michael Glassner, Executive Director.CNN takes issue with the ad s message calling out the mainstream media for peddling fake news and not reporting on the fact that President Trump is making America great again.CNN has struck back, explaining their decision to keep the ad off of the network until the  fake news  graphic was taken off. Trump s attack on the media is absolutely disgusting, and it s only helped them. It s been proven that Americans trust the mainstream media far more than the President   and this is exactly why. We hope that more networks will follow in CNN s footsteps, because no one should have to look at Trump s lies.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"May 2, 2017"
 Andrew Jackson Biographer: Trump Actually Said He Could Have Prevented The Civil War (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s Andrew Jackson-Civil War debacle just continues to get worse and worse.Yesterday, Trump had a massive history fail during a radio interview, where the moronic POTUS stated that Andrew Jackson   who had died 16 years before the Civil War even started   was angry that the war had not been avoided. Trump also said that Jackson could have stopped the Civil War from happening, lavishing praise upon the slave-owning seventh president. And apparently, Trump also thinks that HE could have stopped the Civil War.Trump s disgusting Civil War comments have prompted Andrew Jackson biographer and historian Jon Meacham, the author of  American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House, to speak out and address Trump s comments. According to Meacham, it was White House chief strategist Steve Bannon that made Trump fall in love with Jackson. The historian explained on MSNBC today: I spent an hour, hour and a half with him in May of  16 talking with him about presidents he admired and Jackson never came up. Steve Bannon put this in the conversation after the victory saying this was a Jacksonian moment. It was then that Trump connected himself to Jackson in his usual superficial way. Meacham said: It s a projection of the president s fundamental and enveloping narcissism. And then Meacham dropped this bombshell: He told me a year and a half ago or so, a year ago, that, you know, he thought he could have done a deal to have averted the war. Yes, Trump actually said he could have prevented the war with one of his deals. If it s anything like the  deals  and failed legislation we ve seen so far during his presidency, it s safe to say that Trump would have f*cked that up, too.Meacham also said that being in the White House tends to enhance the  fundamental characteristics  of the serving presidents   which is awful news for America right now. Meacham said: It s very hard, once you re there, to change. Some people do, and that s why we talk about them as great presidents. But most people, once they re in the Oval Office, actually just become more like themselves   and I think in this case that s on a particularly tragic trajectory. We couldn t agree more.

 WATCH: Colbert HUMILIATES Trump With Scathing Takedown To Avenge Attack On John Dickerson,"When you insult CBS, Stephen Colbert goes on the offensive. And Donald Trump is going to have a mental meltdown when he sees this.On Sunday, CBS host John Dickerson interviewed Donald Trump on Face The Nation.After being asked about his pathetic first 100 days, Trump whined about the  fake  media and then insulted Dickerson by saying that he refers to his show as  Deface The Nation. It s always a challenge like life itself is a challenge,  Trump said.  It s very funny when the fake media goes out   which we call the mainstream media, which sometimes, I must say is you. You mean, me personally?  Dickerson asked. Your show, I love your show,  Trump replied.  I call it  Deface the Nation , but your show is sometimes not exactly correct. Trump s insult went viral and was heavily criticized for being the kind of behavior that is beneath the presidency.But Trump created a bigger problem for himself than he thought because Dickerson s friend Stephen Colbert also works for CBS, and while Dickerson had to exercise professionalism and restraint, Colbert informed Trump that as a comedian he isn t held to same standard. Donald Trump, John Dickerson is a fair-minded journalist and one of the most competent people who will ever walk into your office,  Colbert said.  John Dickerson has way too much dignity to trade insults with the president of the United States to his face. But I, sir, am no John Dickerson. With the gauntlet thrown down, Colbert proceeded to tear Trump apart with a scathing round of insults that will turn Trump into a stuttering mess if he ever sees it. Mr. Trump, your presidency? I love your presidency, I call it  Disgrace the Nation.  Colbert said.  You re not the POTUS, you re the BLOTUS. You re the glutton with a button. You re a regular  Gorge  Washington. You re the presi-dunce. But you re turning into a real prictator. You talk like a sign language gorilla who got hit in the head. You have more people marching against you than cancer. And then Colbert delivered the knockout blow. Sir, the only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin s d*ck holster. Absolutely. Sick.

 ‘Grow The F*ck Up!’: Trump Gets Taken To The Woodshed After Calling For A Government Shutdown,"Just yesterday, amateur president Donald Trump made an ass out of himself by failing at history, and today, he s calling for a future government shutdown. Only Trump could f*ck up the past and the future, all in 24-hours. Trump wants to shut down the very government he s leading, which is a thing a real president would try to avoid. Former President Barack Obama made concessions in order to avoid a government shutdown, but the man-baby POTUS is whining on Twitter over the deal which was reached on a $1 trillion-plus bill to fund the government for the final five months of this fiscal year.Even though Republicans control Congress, the Senate and they have installed a Republican  president,  Trump did not get funding for his ineffective border wall, taxpayer dollars will not be spent on a deportation force, the bill includes $295 million for Puerto Rico s Medicaid program and Congress  budget will not defund Planned Parenthood. And that s just the short list.Obviously, this has upset the former reality show star, who previously deemed himself to be a great negotiator.On Twitter, he wrote,  The reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there! We . The reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there! We .  Donald J.

There s a reason the prospect of a government shutdown is hugely unpopular, so one Twitter user schooled him.@realDonaldTrump You're reckless.

 Trump Just Claimed Andrew Jackson Had Psychic Powers And The Internet Was Not Kind To Him (TWEETS),"In an interview with Washington Examiner reporter Salena Zito, Donald Trump managed to utter one of the dumbest series of sentences in human history:I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn t have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart, and he was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War. He said,  There s no reason for this.  People don t realize, you know, the Civil War, you think about it, why?People don t ask that question. But why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?Now, if Trump was an intelligent human being, he might admit he is completely uneducated regarding Andrew Jackson, the Civil War, and pretty much everything else. He would apologize. He would say he was wrong. But Trump? Well, he s a f*cking moron.In what appears to be an effort to convince people he was somehow right when he claimed that Andrew Jackson used the psychic powers bestowed upon him by Satan himself in exchange for that whole Trail of Tears thing Steve Bannon keeps saying we should do again (at least, we can reasonably assume Bannon says that) to foresee  a conflict that occurred 16 years after his death   and he was f*cking pissed about it.President Andrew Jackson, who died 16 years before the Civil War started, saw it coming and was angry. Would never have let it happen!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2017Andrew Jackson would have, had he actually possessed the magical ability to foresee the future, almost certainly used his powers for evil. Slaves represented the majority of Jackson s income. He owned 150 of them when he died. If Jackson had actually known what was coming, he would have done all he could to ensure a Southern victory   you know, had he not died 16 years before the Civil War began. Trump is correct that our seventh President would have been very  angry  about what he would certainly call the War of Northern Aggression, however had he had a heartbeat.Trump s attempt to smooth things over by claiming that Jackson was a psychic didn t quite go over in the world of Twitterville, with Americans stopping by to collectively ask  What the f*ck is wrong with you? @realDonaldTrump You wish that Andrew Jackson an owner of HUNDREDS of slaves should've just made a deal w the South to allow slavery?! pic.twitter.com/We1qOHLlm8  William LeGate (@williamlegate) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Was he angry because he had 150+ slaves?

 Dan Rather Breaks The Internet With SEARING Rebuke Of Trump’s ‘Andrew Jackson’ Comment,"With Trump in the White House, former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather has an awful lot to say, probably because he s been around the political block a couple thousand times, and Trump is a dangerous buffoon, the likes of which we ve never seen. He doesn t comment on everything, and he apparently didn t want to comment on Trump s idea that Andrew Jackson was angry about the Civil War. But he sees something in that absurdity that he felt he needed to point out.According to his Facebook post on the topic, the  sheer craziness of this obsession by Donald Trump with Andrew Jackson and the Civil War is a carnival act unlike anything I have ever seen at the White House. These are the rantings of someone who really should be focused on the job of governing. Should we not conclude that he approaches policy decisions with the same half-baked conspiracies with which he apparently approaches history? Trump, at the very least, has been approaching his presidency with the grand level of ignorance with which he approaches history. He recently told Reuters that he didn t think being the president would be so hard. He also said that nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated.Sure, Trump. The only people who did know are, well, pretty much everyone with the most basic understanding of our current political situation.That isn t all Rather blasted Trump about. He also dropped this truth bomb, with hell of a burn at the end, on Trump: To be President of the United States is to part of the great American story. To not understand that story is to not understand the presidency. Maybe Frederick Douglass can give Mr. Trump some advice. Apparently, he s  an example of somebody who s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more.

 Sean Spicer: Trump Did Not Say That Thing Everyone Heard Him Say (VIDEO),"White House press secretary Sean Spicer literally denied the meaning of alleged president Donald Trump s words during a briefing on Monday. The former reality show star gave a bizarre interview earlier on Monday on CBS  Face the Nation from the Oval Office in which Trump once again, said that former president Barack Obama illegally tapped his phone lines.  I don t stand by anything,  Trump told John Dickerson.  I just, you can take it the way you want. I think our side s been proven very strongly. And everybody s talking about it. The interview ended abruptly with Trump walking away after being pressed by the reporter to back up his claim. So, Spicer was asked about that crazy-time interview then twisted himself into a pretzel in an attempt to defend his boss. The president said,  I don t stand by anything.  How is the American public supposed to digest that, supposed to trust what the president says when he himself says, of his own comments, I don t by anything,  a pool reporter asked Spicer. I think the point is, he clearly stands by that,  Spicer said.  That s something that s made very clear if you look at the entire back and forth exchange. Even though the exchange is documented on video after being televised, Spicer insisted that what we heard is not what we all heard. It was about wiretapping,  the reporter pressed on when asked to be specific. Spicer said it  was a long back and forth  and added that he  clearly stands by that. So, Trump stands by his  I don t stand by anything  remark as well as his conspiracy-theory based wiretap claim. Watch: You don t have to ask me,  Trump responded to one of Dickerson s attempts to clarify his baseless claim.  Because I have my own opinions. You can have your own opinions. The House and Senate Intelligence committees previously announced that there is no evidence to back up Trump s claim. As for Spicer repeatedly asking for clarification, let s help him out. Trump made baseless and unprecedented attacks on his predecessor and his White House press secretary is defending him. Also, according to Trump and his White House press secretary, the alleged president doesn t  stand by anything.  Still yet, Spicer feigned to know nothing about the interview, repeatedly asking for clarification.Why is it when Trump says something, we need it to be translated? Then Spicer muddles it even more. Remember when we had a President who understood the meaning of words?Image via screen capture. ",News,"May 1, 2017"
 Ivanka Trump Legally BARRED From Participating In Any Trump Businesses,"The Office of Government Ethics has said that Ivanka Trump must file financial disclosure forms, and that she s barred from participating in anything related to the Trump family s businesses because she s an adviser to her father in the White House. The ethics office was never contacted about her role, revealing yet another area in which the White House is either sorely ignorant or sorely corrupt (most likely both).Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tom Carper asked the ethics office about the rules that Ivanka is supposed to follow. At the time they asked, Ivanka was in the process of getting her government-issued devices and a security clearance, and her lawyer had already said she would stick to the same ethics rules applied to every other government employee.This is what the ethics office told Warren and Carper about the ethics rules applying to her: [T]he primary criminal conflict of interest statue prohibits senior White House appointees and other executive branch employees from participating personally and substantially in particular matters directly and predictably affecting their financial interests. Among other things, this prohibition extends to the financial interests of companies in which they have ownership interests the primary criminal conflict of interest statute prohibits Ms. Trump from participating in particular matters affecting her financial interests, including the financial interests of Trump family businesses and other companies in which she has an ownership interest. That conflict of interest statute also covers her spouse s financial interests, which are imputed to her. So even if her husband, Jared Kushner, didn t have his own White House office, he still couldn t participate in the Trump Organization either.Ivanka s company was granted trademarks in China the same day she had dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The company said that the new trademarks are normal for the business that they do, and she did place her company in a trust and resigned from her position in the Trump Organization to accept her White House role. The Trump Organization, however, has likewise received a number of trademarks in China since Trump took office.She maintains financial control of her own company, though, as well as an interest in Washington s Trump International Hotel, according to The New York Times. These ethics rules apply to financial interests, even for employees and executives who ve formally resigned from their positions in their businesses. And those Chinese trademarks, granted after she took her post in the White House, could violate the ethics rules to which she s bound. Her ability to approve or deny certain deals through her trust may violate those rules as well.Unfortunately, ethics compliance is under the purview of the White House, and the White House is pretty loyal to Donald Trump and has shown zero interest in ensuring ethical compliance. The ethics office doesn t have enforcement power   they just issue guidance. Congressional Democrats now have a powerful case against Ivanka should it come to light that she s violating these rules, though.There s word for this if she doesn t bring herself into full compliance: Corruption.Featured image by Sean Gallup via Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2017"
" Trump Tries To Launch 2020 Re-election Ad, It IMMEDIATELY Blows Up In His Face (TWEET)","From the moment Trump won the election, he was already bragging about how he was going to run again in 2020, and win.In a move that shows just how delusional Trump truly is, the undeserving POTUS ignored the fact that his approval rating has reached a historic low by launching his first ad for his 2020 bid. And in true Trump fashion, the ad was one big embarrassing fail, as Trump was forced to pull the ad over an obvious violation   it violated the ban that prevents active duty military members in uniform from participating in political stunts.The Washington Post wrote: The initial version of the ad released by the campaign included a shot of Trump shaking hands at his Mar-a-Lago estate with H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser. An updated version dropped the shot of McMaster, who remains an active duty member of the Army, and replaced it with Trump visiting a business. Campaign law expert Larry Noble also pointed this out:It should be noted that Trump pathetically celebrated Inauguration Day by filing for re-election, probably to soothe himself after seeing those tiny crowds. This ad is the perfect embodiment of Trump s sloppy administration   these people have no idea how to run the country, which trickles down to the most simple tasks.From what we ve seen from Trump himself, his White House doesn t really pay attention to detail or do their research first before going all in. Trump s team has had to repeatedly correct themselves, and not even a simple campaign ad can go off without a hitch.Not even halfway through his first term, Trump has already made his bid for re-election a joke and displayed just how incompetent his entire team is. It s no wonder the majority of Americans can t wait until this clown and the rest of his circus are out of the White House.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2017"
" Trump Has CRAZY Meltdown On ‘Face The Nation’, Ends Interview In The Most COWARDLY Way (VIDEO)","Donald Trump and his team are not only some of the most corrupt people we ve ever had infiltrate our government, but they re also some of the most cowardly   and Trump has just set an example to his team that will likely give way to even more spineless behavior.In an interview with CBS s Face The Nation, Trump actually cut the interview short, ending it abruptly by literally fleeing from reporter John Dickerson when Dickerson dared to question Trump about his unfounded claims that former POTUS Barack Obama wiretapped him (Trump has STILL not been able to prove this).Dickerson was speaking to Trump inside the Oval Office when the discussion turned to Trump s relationship with Obama, and Trump made some extremely disrespectful, inflammatory remarks. Trump said he d  had some difficulties  with Obama over  what happened with surveillance.  When Dickerson cornered Trump on why he d called his predecessor  sick  and  bad  in his wiretapping accusations in March, Trump practically had a breakdown from being put on the spot while the cameras rolled. Trump gave this incoherent response: I don t stand by anything. I just, you can take it the way you want. I think our side s been proven very strongly. And everybody s talking about it. And frankly it should be discussed. I think that is a very big surveillance of our citizens. I think it s a very big topic. And it s a topic that should be number one. And we should find out what the hell is going on. Trump only seemed to get more frustrated and edgy as Dickerson tried to get to the bottom of Trump s babbling. Trump said: You don t have to ask me.Because I have my own opinions. You can have your own opinions. Dickerson had tried to hold Trump accountable, and it was just too much for the man baby. Trump suddenly ended the interview by straight up walking AWAY from Dickerson, saying  Okay, that s enough, thank you, thank you very much.

" Trump Kills Michelle Obama’s Girl Education Program, Right-Wing ‘Feminist’ Ivanka Silent","Trump has been relentlessly attempting to scrub the government of any program associated with President Obama and an extremely popular program meant to help educated girls and young women around the world has become the latest victim.Characteristically, Trump s administration gave zero defense for cutting the program, just a flat announcement that it was finished. Moving forward, we will not continue to use the  Let Girls Learn  brand or maintain a stand-alone program,  read an email sent to Peace Corps employees this week by the agency s acting director Sheila Crowley.Despite the self-created obstacles, the Peace Corps promised to continue attempting to educate young girls around the world through other means. It doesn t seem likely that they will get much input from Trump, who has not signaled that he cares about girls education one way or the other.One person not involved in this mess is Ivanka Trump   which is weird. Republicans and pundits have spent months insisting that Trump s daughter is a rebel feminist working to push her father and his administration into a more pro-woman direction. The evidence for this take on Ivanka is nonexistent. And Trump s dismantling of a program meant to educate girls seems like a perfect opportunity to put up or shut up. Her big moment to stand up for women and she is dead silent.Ivanka s imaginary check on her father didn t prevent him from going after Michelle Obama s efforts to improve school lunches, either. Obama s initiative was meant to combat America s obesity program and help kids have better access to healthy options while in school. Those reasonable goals were savaged by Republicans who by that time had spent so long hating everything the White House did that they rarely stopped to ask themselves whether the things they were after were bad.Trump inherits that knee-jerk opposition to Obama, but now as president he has the ability to actually act on it. And the one person who might have the influence to stop him proves she s all talk.Feature image via Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2017"
 WATCH: Trump Frighteningly Praises North Korean Dictator For Executing People To Stay In Power,"This should concern every single American.In January 2016, Trump was in the middle of trying to secure the Republican nomination when he praised North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un s deadly strategy of maintaining his power. If you look at North Korea, this guy, he s like a maniac. OK? And you ve got to give him credit. How many young guys   he was like 26 or 25 when his father died   take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden   you know, it s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture, and it s a cultural thing, he goes in, he takes over, he s the boss. It s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. This guy doesn t play games, and we can t play games with him. And Trump still admires that strategy more than a year later. Only this time, Trump is in the White House.During his interview with John Dickerson on Sunday, Trump once again expressed his admiration of the North Korean dictator s use of execution to remain in power. People are saying  Is he sane?  I have no idea but he was a young man of 26 or 27 when he took over from his father, when his father died. He s dealing with obviously very tough people. A lot of people, I m sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it, so obviously, he s a pretty smart cookie. Here s the video via CBS.This should scare Americans, especially since it appears Trump is employing other strategies that tyrants use to consolidate power.So far, Trump has used threats, intimidation, hate, and fear as tools to expand and consolidate his own power. He has attacked the media and the First Amendment. He is so paranoid that he even conducts witch hunts throughout his administration to find and fire people who leak information to the media. Anyone who criticizes him also gets fired, as one of Ben Carson s aides found out in February.And Kim Jong-Un isn t the first dictator Trump has praised. He praised Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte last year and has invited him to visit the White House. Trump has openly praised Vladimir Putin. And he shook hands with Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.A president taking the step of executing people may sound like an impossibility. But Trump exhibits most of the traits of being a fascist. He has already flouted the laws of our country and ignored the Constitution. Republicans in Congress have demonstrated that they really don t care how Trump uses his power, which means he can abuse it. And he has already done so repeatedly. Trump colluded with Russia to steal the election and he has openly accused a former sitting president of a felony. And that s on top of a mountain of lies that Trump has been telling since his inauguration. Trump has also urged his followers to beat up protesters and has made it clear that he considers Americans who oppose him as the enemy.Trump s praise of Kim Jong-Un s use of executions should make Americans scream even louder for his impeachment or resignation. There s a pattern here and Americans need to recognize it because we are only 100 days into a four-year term, and it could only be a matter of time before Trump takes his desire to be a dictator to the next level.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2017"
" Trump Freaks Out, Ends Interview When Reporter Asks Him To Prove Obama Wiretap Accusation (VIDEO)","In an unreal feat, Trump managed to have two humiliating interviews come out on the same day. While much of the country (and indeed, the world) was laughing at Trump for his insane screed about the Civil War, CBS News released their own interview with Trump which showed the president descending into sheer madness when pressed to support his (false) claim that President Obama wiretapped him. For those worried about the mental stability of the person currently within arm s reach of America s nuclear arsenal, it was perhaps the more disturbing of the two interviews.You can almost hear Trump s staffers groan when he, out of nowhere, brings up the wiretap claims. Sensing a moment to finally press Trump on these unsubstantiated smears of his predecessor, CBS s John Dickerson asks Trump pointblank whether he still stands by the accusations that Obama is a  bad and sick  guy who had committed felonies on par with Nixon s Watergate scandal. Since making the claims, Trump s arguments have been repeatedly debunked and zero evidence to support him has emerged. Has he changed his mind?Just the opposite. He appears to have become even more delusional: I think our side s been proven very strongly and everybody s talking about it and frankly, it should be discussed. Trump added,  We should find out what the hell is going on. Dickerson:  I m asking you because you don t want it to be fake news. I want to hear it from President Trump. Trump:  You don t have to ask me. You don t have to ask me. Dickerson:  Why not? Trump:  Because I have my own opinions, you can have your own opinions. Dickerson points out that Trump s  own opinions  are kind of important because he s the president of the United States. At this point, Trump shuts down completely, ending the interview and running to his desk. The last shot the camera captures is Trump visibly fuming. Facts, it seems, irritate him.Featured image via CBS News",News,"May 1, 2017"

I think it s something that we ve looked at, and how that gets executed or whether that goes anywhere is a different story,  Priebus replied. So you think the President should be able to sue the New York Times for stories he doesn t like?  Karl continued to press. I think that newspapers and news agencies need to be more responsible with how they report the news,  Priebus responded.  I am so tired. I don t think anyone would disagree with that,  Karl said.  It s about whether or not the President should have the right to sue them. And I already answered the question. I said this is something that is being looked at,  Priebus said.

 Trump Just Got WRECKED By Chelsea Clinton Over His Dumbass Slavery Remarks (TWEETS/VIDEO),"Anyone who has been to grade school is fully aware that Andrew Jackson died before a certain bloody conflict in which southerners fought their countrymen (former countrymen if you consider the Confederacy to be legitimate like many Trump supporters do) over the right to own other human beings, but Donald Trump has his own  alternative facts  about  swashbuckler  Jackson.Trump says he learned during a recent visit to Tennessee that  they love Andrew Jackson  down there, questioning whether Jackson, who owned 150 men, women, and children when he died in 1845, could have stopped the Civil War, which began in 1861, if he had  been a little bit later. I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later you wouldn t have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart,  Trump told the Washington Post s Salena Zito. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said,  There s no reason for this.' Yes, according  to Trump, slave owner Andrew Jackson was angry about a war that began long after his death and totally would have acted against his own self-interest (slavery was the source of all of his money) to stop it if he hadn t been so dead. But he was mad. Then Trump wondered why the Civil War happened in the first place   a question appropriate coming from someone who thinks a hardcore slave owner would have stopped it: People don t ask that question, but why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out? Fortunately,  Crooked Hillary s  daughter stepped up to provide him with the answer in a manner Trump may understand: under 140 characters:1 word answer: Slavery.

Appropriately, The Donald told Zito that his campaign was a lot like that of Jackson, who also called for  severe penalties  for  the circulation of incendiary publications.  Trump, who is exploring suing journalists for stories he does not like, just says  FAKE NEWS  because he s nowhere near as intelligent as the slave-owning former president he thinks would have stopped the Civil War.Naturally, Twitter loved watching Trump get dragged by the former First Daughter:@ChelseaClinton @IndependentlyE If you think Andrew Jackson was mad about the Civil War, you should have heard his thoughts on Vietnam.

 Neo-Nazi Rally Met With Strong Resistance By Local Town (DETAILS),"Neo-Nazis and white supremacists gathered in Pikeville, Kentucky yesterday. They were met by scores of protesters who booed the group. Approximately 70 members of the Traditionalist Workers Party, the League of the South and the National Socialist Movement were heavily armed when they gathered at the courthouse in town.Pike County is a very white place. At least 98 percent of the people who live there are white. The area also went heavily for President Donald Trump. Eighty percent of the people there voted for Trump. These are the reasons that Pikeville was selected for the rally. The neo-Nazis and white supremacists are looking to become more politically relevant. They picked the area because they thought their message would appeal to the working class people who live there.Pikeville residents wanted no part of the message the rally organizers were trying to spread. Most of the rally supporters are not from Pikevillee. Lifelong Pikeville resident, Elizabeth White said,  We have no clue why they would even pick Pickville. Why don t they go disrespect their own homes, their own people, their own families? We need Trump to tell them to go back to their own place. There had been a lot of concern about the rally as recent protests around the country have turned violent. One protester was shot in the abdomen at an event in Seattle. Several people were stabbed at another event in Sacramento. Unlike Washington and California, which have strict gun control laws, Kentucky residents are allowed to carry weapons. Organizers of the Pikeville protest said beforehand that their people would be heavily armed. That led some to be concerned that violence at the protest could turn deadly.Luckily, none of that happened. The three hour rally included harsh words from both sides but was peaceful. As the protesters left town, people protesting the protest shouted,  Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out and stay the fuck out. You are not welcome here.

In it, he said there was a traitor at Fox News, and claimed to know who it is. After Bill O Reilly s ouster amid a sexual harassment scandal, people began saying that  they  were going to come after Hannity.Sure enough, Schlussel came forward saying that Hannity had been creepy with her. Hannity has repeatedly denied that he was even remotely inappropriate with her, and he and his followers seem to think that she s either an active participant in some grand conspiracy to shut down Fox News (and indeed, conservatives in general) entirely, or a pawn that  they  are using to take down every conservative there is.Honestly, he sounds too much like Trump, dropping saying on Twitter that he s got all this information and hinting that it could blow something wide open. Since he s a television personality, it s a little more likely that he s actually got something on someone (or a lot of someones), but then again he really does sound like Trump blowing hot air and this could wind up being a huge nothingburger.He shut down before he  said too much  to his Twitter audience, and is now simply saying,  stay tuned.  So he s hinting that he and his  team  are going to bust something wide open.

 Trump Administration Just Pressured Argentina Into Not Honoring Jimmy Carter With An Award,"The Trump administration explicitly requested that Argentine President Mauricio Macri delay honoring former Democratic President Jimmy Carter with an award. Marci planned to award Carter the Order of the Liberator General San Martin, the highest distinction in that country to a foreign person, but pressure from the Trump administration caused the honor to be delayed.Carter, who has been a critic of Trump s administration, was set to be honored by Argentina with the award which is the equivalent to America s Medal of Freedom.The Buenos Aires Herald reports:The Mauricio Macri administration reverted a decision to award former US president Jimmy Carter the Order of the Liberator General San Mart n   the maximum distinction that the country can give to a foreign personality  , under the pressure from US President Donald Trump s administration, CNN web site reported this week.The official tribute, which had already been approved by the foreign ministry and was published in the Official Gazette, was cancelled after receiving a specific request by the US government, which would have suggested it would be better to delay it. Carter was to be given the award for his work in promoting human rights during Argentina s last military dictatorship.According to CNN, an Argentinean official spoke on condition of anonymity and said the decision not to carry out the official delivery to Jimmy Carter was  to avoid conflicts  and to talk about matters of mutual interest between the two countries.CNN reports:The council that studies who to grant the distinction in the Chancellery of Argentina had approved the distinction to the former president for his work for peace and for his contribution to human rights during the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla when Carter was president of the United States.Trump has never been kind to his critics. Carter, on the other hand, is just a soul who, since leaving office, does charitable work for the needy.

Bush and Bill Clinton in their first 100 days.Dow Jones Industrial Average   Change after first 3 months in office: Trump vs. Obama vs. Bush vs. Clinton. pic.twitter.com/ve8RqFCByx  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017Hourly wages after the President s first 3 months in office: Trump vs. Obama vs. Bush vs. Clinton. pic.twitter.com/KMjQHBTEEd  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017Jobless rate after first 3 months: Trump vs. Obama vs. Bush vs. Clinton. pic.twitter.com/w8FzJJ9nXc  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017Jobs added during first 2 months   Trump vs. Obama vs. Bush vs. Clinton. pic.twitter.com/paBPjhfNiN  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017However, Fox News apparently ignored the fact that presidents inherit the state of the economy from their predecessors.For instance, President Obama inherited the Great Recession from President Bush, which is why the economy during his first 100 days stood in shambles as 1.5 million jobs were lost, unemployment topped 9 percent, and GDP dropped by 5 percent.In other words, President Obama was not responsible for those economic losses. But he did reverse them.After eight years in office, President Obama managed to bring down the unemployment rate to 4.8 percent, oversaw the longest streak of job creation on record and created 11.3 million jobs. Obama s best year for average GDP growth was in 2015 at 2.6 percent, but he did have many months that topped three percent. And he did all of this despite Republican obstruction at every turn.Donald Trump inherited Obama s economy, which is why he is touting it as his  achievement. The fact is, however, that we won t really know what Trump s economy will be until his policies take effect.So far, Trump has touted 500,000 jobs created, but that number is lower because he included the entire month of January, which rightfully should be in Obama s column. Trump s first three months in office also shows a GDP of 0.7 percent, far lower than the 4 percent he promised on the campaign trail.But again, Trump inherited Obama s economy, so he owes the positive growth rate that he is starting with to President Obama.When it comes to wages, Trump also doesn t have a leg to stand on. Many states passed laws increasing the minimum wage in 2015 and 2016, many of which went into effect this year. Meanwhile, the federal minimum wage remains at $7.25 an hour. Republicans refused to raise the federal wage during Obama s presidency. Trump himself opposes raising the minimum wage and his first Labor Secretary appointee supported killing minimum wage laws entirely. Republicans also still largely oppose the minimum wage. With that much opposition to minimum wage, including Trump s own opposition against it, he can hardly take credit for the minimum wage boosts that have occurred.These graphics were incredibly misleading and were clearly designed to make Trump look good at the expense of President Obama. But the tweets backfired spectacularly as Twitter users pointed out that they were not only lies, but demonstrated that Republican presidents inherit good economies from Democratic predecessors.@FoxNews What a stupid comparison  Obama inherited Bush s & Trump inherited Obama s. The rate of job growth has declined 50% (!) under Trump.

 Trump Could Get Primaried By A Horrified #NEVERTRUMP Republican In 2020 (DETAILS),"Ohio Governor and former Republican presidential candidate John Kasich is the one GOP elected official that is still not on the Trump Train. The other party loyalists have fallen in line, with the occasional criticisms from folks like Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Senator John McCain (R-AZ). Infamously, Gov. Kasich did not attend the Republican National Convention even though it was in his home state and he was the sitting Governor. He also refused to praise or endorse Trump, or demand that others in his party do so. Now, it seems he may be looking at a way to take his party back from The Donald in 2020.Gov. Kasich s gubernatorial term will end in 2019, due to term limits. Therefore, he also will be looking to see what his next project will be. For now, he has been touring the talk show circuit promoting a book, and that has been the focus of these conversations. However, a man who was once an aide to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, Ryan Williams, says of Kasich s 2020 prospects: Kasich is kind of in limbo   his time as governor will end when he s termed out, he doesn t have a path toward any other office in Ohio, and if Trump runs for reelection, I doubt he ll challenge him. That, however, does not mean that Kasich won t be throwing his hat into the 2020 ring. Williams goes on to say: But he s trying to keep his name in the mix in case President Trump decides not to run again   He, like many people, was counting on President Trump to lose in November, expecting to occupy a space in the effort to rebuild the party. But that evaporated the minute Trump won the election. Still, though, Kasich remains skeptical of Trump as president, and refuses to rule out challenging Trump. When asked, he ducks the question and essentially says he isn t running right now, he is promoting his book.In short, it seems that Kasich knows that Trump is terrible for the country, and really has no loyalty to the man. Further, with Trump s increasingly divisive policies and rhetoric continuing to rip at the fabric of the nation, he may feel the obligation to do what he can to unseat Trump in the primary and deny him the nomination a second time. In fact, when asked, Kasich said: What I m saying is it s unlikely, but I don t know what the future is going to bring for me, or what responsibility or obligation I might feel. The more Trump rips the nation apart, something tells me that obligation will feel a lot stronger by the time 2020 rolls around if Trump isn t impeached first.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 30, 2017"
 WATCH: Former Reagan Adviser Is Totally DISGUSTED By Trump’s Divisive Rally Speech,"Donald Trump treated Americans who oppose him as the enemy on Saturday and delivered the most divisive speech ever given by a president.Rather than attend the White House Correspondents  Dinner, Trump skipped the event instead to hold a rally in Pennsylvania where he displayed the kind of pettiness and divisiveness that are unprecedented in presidential history. It s time for all of us to remember that we are one people with one great American destiny, and that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, and we all share the same glorious freedoms of our magnificent country,  Trump said, suggesting that Americans who oppose him are not patriots.Trump also bragged about the size of his crowd, despite the fact that it was not a  record,  and bragged about his  achievements  in his first 100 days even though he has been a complete failure who has done nothing but sign tyrannical executive orders and play golf while having no major legislation reach the Oval Office desk.Indeed, Trump s attempt to repeal the popular Affordable Care Act failed spectacularly and his executive orders on immigration have been blocked by the courts.Trump also treated a protester like shit at the rally, ordering security to  get him out of here,  as Nazis stood by in approval.Trump speech was not presidential. It was meant strictly to pander to his vile base of deplorable supporters who still supoort him no matter how much he lies or how much he destroys our country.And David Gergen, who served as an adviser to Nixon, Ford, and Reagan, trashed Trump s  disturbing  speech. This was the most divisive speech I have ever heard from a sitting American president,  Gergen said.  Others may disagree about that. He played to his base and he treated his other listeners, the rest of the people who have been disturbed about him or opposed him, he treated them basically as,  I don t give a damn what you think because you re frankly like the enemy.  I thought it was a deeply disturbing speech. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump should be impeached and everything he has done should be reversed and erased as if he never held office. He should also be put in prison for colluding with Russia, attempting to sabotage the United States, and violating the Constitution. Acting like a hateful and vengeful dictator should not be tolerated in this country.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 30, 2017"
 WATCH: Trump Bashes “Face the Nation” During Interview On…Face The Nation,"It is no secret that President Donald Trump likes to call any press coverage that he does not like  fake.  This weekend he upped the ante a bit when he did an interview with John Dickerson for CBS s Face the Nation. Trump took the opportunity to bash the show to the show s host.After Dickerson called Trump out on some of his policy reversals over the course of the first 100 days of his presidency, this exchange happened: It s always a challenge like life itself is a challenge. It s very funny when the fake media goes out   which we call the mainstream media, which sometimes, I must say is you,  said Trump.

 Trump Fan Just Got His Pride DEMOLISHED By A 7th Grader In Epic Letter To A Newspaper,"A Trump supporter thought he was clever when he wrote a letter to the editor of his local paper, the Winchester Star, criticizing  Hate has no home here  signs that were popping up in his area. The signs feature the phrase written in a number of languages and should be seen as a positive thing by everyone, but Trump supporters are filled to the brim with hatred, so self-described  50-year Tea Partier became  triggered  and wrote an angry letter full of so much whining  that it would cause notorious white grievance princess and former Blaze personality Tomi Lahren to scream  SNOWFLAKE  for six hours in an unhinged Facebook video post if a liberal wrote it.Natale posed a number of incredibly stupid questions he didn t expect to be answered   but then a 7th grader by the name of Luke Macannuco answered them and delivered a smackdown so hard that the Tea Partier might think twice about saying or writing something this stupid again (Oh, who are we kidding? He won t). I read, with great interest, Mr. John Natale s colossal misunderstanding of the  Hate Has No Home Here  signs. Natale s first mistake was claiming the signs read,  Hate has no place in this home .  the teen s letter begins.  Mr. Natale is incorrectly assuming that the owners of the sign are finding it necessary to state that there is no hate in their home. But, as the American flag depicted on the sign signifies, the posters are referencing the entire U.S.A., a country that does not tolerate hate in spite of its current leadership. Those people who have chosen to place a  Hate Has No Home Here  sign on their lawn are standing behind their belief that the country should be free of hate. The teen then addressed the meat of Natale s moronic writings, and it is the best thing you will read for quite some time  until you see what came after it, that is:Mr. Natale also lists questions that have remained unanswered, so it is my duty to define his burning inquiries:1. Question:  Who are the haters that you, the sign owner, are referring to?  Answer: Bigots who are trying to take away protections for transgender students, deport refugees and build a very expensive wall to keep illegal immigrants out (which is completely pointless and not helping your cause, but I digress).2. Question:  What, or whom, do the haters hate?  Answer: Perfectly innocent human beings who happen to be different from the haters.3. Question:  What is the evidence that there is significant hate in our community?  Answer: Me getting called homosexual slurs by students and adults alike.4. Question:  Obviously, you are so morally superior that you may declare everyone who disagrees with you a hater (side note: this first part is a statement, not a question). Where, when, and how did you become the Lord High Decider of Morality?  Answer: Never. We just put a lawn sign down. Calm down, dude.This is enough to have most right-wingers peeing themselves like a couple of Russian prostitutes on a certain billionaire s Moscow hotel bed, but our hero wasn t done:As I stated previously, the signs are not talking exclusively about Winchester. The signs are about the whole United States. They also aren t implying you are a hater if you disagree; where did you get that idea? Also, Mr. Natale, if you re going to ask us to do you a favor and take the signs down, do humanity a favor and take your Trump signs down. Finally, if you are going to say signs exhibit  snowflake sensitivity,  take a moment to think about how you are writing an angry letter to a newspaper about a lawn sign.And the crowd went wild:@segalmr @fuggirls  If ur going to think signs display  snowflake sensitivity    think about how you are writing a letter to a newspaper about a sign.  pic.twitter.com/5cOopDqQb0  Sela Lewis (@SelaNehanda) April 29, 2017@segalmr @AlJavieera Controlled burn.

He is now upset with President Donald Trump and wishes he could take his vote back.Jones told the crowd: I m sorry I voted for the son of a bitch, I really am. I m sorry I spent $180 out of my own pocket to buy three big banners that said,  President Trump, build the wall ,  the blazer-clad Jones said, to a tent full of about 100 men, some of whom wore paramilitary-style uniforms.

 Schumer Breaks It Down: Explains Why Trump Hasn’t Accomplished Sh*t (VIDEO),"Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer broke things down on Sunday and explained why it is that Donald Trump hasn t been able to accomplish squat so far.Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Schumer gave a scathing review of Trump s first 100 days, which he said had  hardly been a success.  He laid into Trump for his litany of broken promises, including his failed health care bill and decision to add more monsters to the swamp rather than draining it. There s been promise after promise that s been either unfulfilled or broken,  he said. The bottom line is very simple: the president, if he works with us, particularly on issues like trade and infrastructure, we can work. But on the issues so far, taxes and healthcare, he doesn t consult us at all. According to Schumer, Trump comes up with a plan that s very hard right  and then tells Democrats that supporting the plan is the only  way to be bipartisan. That s not how America works,  Schumer said.The Senate minority leader then scorched Trump on his failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He pointed out that Trump didn t need a single Democrat to vote for his bill in order to pass it. And it still failed miserably. He s not governing from the middle, he s governing from the hard right. That s why his regime has had hardly any major successes, with the exception of Gorsuch. If he changes, we can work together. But he can t just dictate what he wants,  Schumer said. The country doesn t work my way or the highway. Trump, for his part, spent the weekend attacking Democrats, Schumer in specific. On Saturday, Trump slammed Schumer as  a bad leader.  On Sunday, he said that without a leader,  Democrats  have become the party of obstruction.  He then continued that theme during an interview with Face The Nation on Sunday morning.You can watch Schumer s interview here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 30, 2017"
 Trump Goes BALLISTIC As White House Correspondents Dinner Continues Without Him (VIDEO),"Donald Trump may be one of the most bitter, petty people on the planet. Several weeks ago, Trump announced that he would not be attending the White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington because he couldn t handle the media s criticism. As the WH Correspondents Dinner finally took place last night without Trump, he basically threw a fit during a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania because the event was held  without the president. If Trump expected the annual event to be canceled because the country s commander-in-chief decided to be a temperamental man-baby, he was proven wrong last night   and obviously couldn t handle the fact that the media and several celebrities still wanted to go. In an unhinged, unpresidential rant, Trump blasted the media and all in attendance of the WH Correspondents Dinner.Trump lied and said he could not possibly more thrilled  to be far away from the  Washington swamp , where the reporters were consoling each other in a hotel ballroom.  Trump then bragged about the size of his crowds in comparison to the dinner before pointing to the cameras and saying they would actually rather be here.  Trump s delusional fans loved every second of it, and were soon chanting  CNN sucks , encouraging Trump to go off even more on  fake news . He said: They would love to be with us here tonight, but they re trapped at the dinner which will be very, very boring. With the encouragement from the crowd, Trump then recycled all his usual attacks, such as Hillary Clinton and the New York Times   a tactic Trump regularly uses because he isn t intelligent enough to talk about his actual policies.If there was ever a speech that displayed just how insecure and small-minded Trump is, it was this one.

One highlight of the evening came when Will Ferrell took the stage and reprised his impression of former President George W. Bush.The comedian used his time to lampoon the current president. George W. had a lot of good advice for President Donald Trump from what he should eat ( Eat a salad. ) to providing sensible fashion tips ( Your tie should stop at your belt buckle ). Ferrell s W. also noted that before Trump moved into the White House, the 43rd president was considered to be the worst president in history.In addition to performances by Will Ferrell and Samantha Bee, the show also featured appearances by Allison Janney, Carl Reiner, Billy Eichner, Paula Pell and Norman Lear.Here s the video:Featured image via TBS",News,"April 30, 2017"
 Donald Trump Learned A New Word And It Should Give You Chills (VIDEO),"Donald Trump isn t enjoying his time as President. In a series of interviews marking the first 100 days of his presidency, he s done an awful lot of whining and complaining, including saying that the job is much harder than he thought.One of the reasons the job is so hard for him is that he s not a dictator, as much as he d like to be one. His powers are limited by a document called the Constitution and that frustrates the hell out of him, even though he has an entirely Republican federal government.In an interview with Fox News on Friday, Trump appeared to have learned a new word, and he used it four times in reference to the Constitution. That word was  archaic,  and in his context, it was particularly disconcerting because it signaled his desire to completely do away with the constraints of the Constitution and with our system of checks and balances.Remember when White nationalist House stooge and millennial most likely to be punched Steven Miller said that  that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned?  A collective chill went up the spines of thinking Americans. Be prepared to feel that chill again. Here s what Trump said on Friday.In an interview with Fox News to mark the 100-day mark, he declared himself  disappointed  with congressional Republicans, despite his many  great relationships  with them.He blamed the constitutional checks and balances built in to US governance.  It s a very rough system,  he said.  It s an archaic system   It s really a bad thing for the country. Here s the video:Mostly, Trump wants to get rid of the filibuster. He has no authority whatsoever over the rules of the Senate, and while the Senate leadership could change the rules, in theory, it would be quite short-sighted because it would mean that the next time Democrats have even a slim majority, Republicans would be powerless to get anything accomplished or to stop a Democratic agenda.When President Obama wasn t able to get past the filibuster, Donald Trump called him weak and ineffectual. Now that the loafer is on Trump s foot, it s the Constitution s fault. Do you have chills yet?Featured image via Getty Images/Pool",News,"April 30, 2017"
 Trump’s Favorite New Dictator Just Cut Off Access To Wikipedia,"The Turkish government has blocked access to Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia. When people throughout the country try to access the site, all they will see is a swirly symbol until they see a message that the connection to the server has timed out. Turkey was recently subject to a failed coup attempt, and in the aftermath President Erdo an used the incident to seize greater powers over the government, becoming a dictator. Trump praised this.The official reason the Turkish government has given is that the site,  has started acting as part of the circles who carry out a smear campaign against Turkey in the international arena, rather than being cooperative in fight against terror.  This is according to a statement by Turkish ministry officials. There have been articles posted to Wikipedia that equate the Turkish government with various terror groups.The Turkey Blocks organization that watches for these kinds of blocks announced the government actions against Wikipedia. Johnny Wales, the founder of Wikipedia took to Twitter to voice his objections. He posted,  Access to information is a fundamental human right. The Turkish people I will always stand with you to fight for this right. While other sites are working normally right now, the Turkish government has used its power to cut off access to other sites in the past. For example, it blocked access to YouTube for several months in 2014. This was in response to a video the site showed of a meeting in Syria on security. The year before that, the government shut off access to a variety of social media channels such as Twitter and Facebook due to bomb attacks or widespread protests.Last November, limitations were placed on access to Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and WhatsApp.Some clever internet users have been able to get around the blocks by using VPNs. Increasingly, the government has been finding ways to keep these users from accessing banned sites.The government admits that from  time to time for security reasons we can use such measures  These are temporary measures. Once the danger is passed, everything returns to normal.  This is according to Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.Featured image via Getty Images",News,"April 29, 2017"

 Elizabeth Warren Was Asked Why She Went To Trump’s Inauguration. Her Response Will TERRIFY Him (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has a major issue with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). This was apparent during his entire presidential campaign, when he basically had a meltdown every time Warren dared to criticize him or call him out on his bullsh*t. Trump had every reason to fear Warren   she was one of his most outspoken critics, and it made Americans love and respect her even more. She has a huge following and was highly influential in her role in the anti-Trump movement, so it was surprising to many that she attended Trump s inauguration. But now, we know why she went.Several Democrats couldn t bear to see Trump get sworn in, and we can t blame them. Warren, however, made it a point to show up despite the fact that Trump insulted her many times, nicknaming her  Pocahontas . On Bill Maher s Real Time, Warren told Maher just what she was thinking by going to an inauguration that she clearly did not want to see happen. She said: I went to Trump s inauguration. I watched. I wanted to see it. I wanted it burned into my eyes. My view on this was that if there were ever going to be a moment when I was like,  Uhh, I m too tired to get up,  all I ve got to do is close my eyes and I m like,  Oh God, I m up! I m up! I m up! I m ready! I m back in the fight. Warren shared the sentiments of most Americans when she said that the day after Trump s inauguration was when  the world changed    but she encouraged Americans to stay positive. While Trump had been sworn in, the historic Women s March also took place that weekend. Warren said that Trump s election helped Americans find their voices and passion: It will be about the day we made our voices heard. It s clear that watching Trump s inauguration helped light a fire inside Warren, and she s using it as fuel to keep fighting Trump and the GOP. This is going to terrify Trump, and she knows it.

 WATCH: Rob Reiner Destroys Team Trump Claims that Obama Should Be Blamed for Flynn,"All week, Team Trump has been trying to push all the blame for Michael Flynn s actions onto the Obama administration. Despite the fact that Flynn did not start working for foreign governments until after he was fired, they still think they can say it is all Barack Obama s fault. Rob Reiner is having none of it.This morning on AM Joy, Reiner said: This man who is the head of our country is a pathological liar and everybody around him is lying. There s no way to other way to look at this thing. Not only did we know about Michael Flynn, there were a number of articles, there was a letter written by the House Oversight Committee. It was well-known what Michael Flynn was doing, he was fired by Barack Obama, so that is clear. The one thing that they have been successful at so far is obfuscating the biggest single story that is permeating this country right now, and that is the invasion of a foreign power, a hostile foreign power into our democracy. And the Michael Flynn story, aside from the fact that he was taking money from Turkey, from Russia, from places and clearly that s a criminal behavior, the main part of the story, and something that we haven t even talked about is: why? Why with the White House knowing full well that this is who he was, they still appointed him National Security Adviser? At first the gang that can t shoot straight looked like it was incompetent because they may not have bothered to do any vetting of Flynn before letting him take over as the National Security Advisor. Now it looks like they either did not understand the law or the Constitution and the rules the military needs to adhere to or they knew the rules and didn t care that Flynn broke them. Either way, putting Flynn in such a sensitive post, with access to the most classified data, was never a good idea. While Flynn was getting the same briefing as the President-Elect, he penned an op-ed for The Hill urging more support for Turkey. When that piece was written, Flynn was receiving money from the Turkish government.Featured image via Amanda Edwards/Getty Images.",News,"April 29, 2017"
 Team Trump Knew Flynn Broke The Law And Hired Him Anyway (DETAILS),"While most Americans did not know about Michael Flynn s ties to Turkey, Team Trump did. When they were vetting the former general, they did learn of Flynn s work for both Turkey and Russia. They knew he had violated the law and the U.S. Constitution and they hired him to be the National Security Advisor anyway.MSNBC s Rachel Maddow said this on her show on Friday night,  NBC News has learned from sources close to the Trump-Russia investigation that both the Trump transition and the White House did do a background check on Flynn.  She went on to say that the vetting Team Trump did of Flynn was done  very casually. The new reporting by NBC News mirrors the claims Flynn has been making for some time that he and his lawyers were upfront with the vetting team about the lobbying he was doing on behalf of the Turkish government.For its part, the White House has taken to blaming the Obama administration. Flynn worked as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). His job at the DIA did require he receive a top secret clearance but it is important to note that he was fired from that job in 2014 (he started there in 2011), this was a full year before he was scheduled to retire.This week, Press Secretary Sean Spicer indicated that the transition team relied on the vetting that had been done by the Obama Administration. The timing of this is important to note because Flynn did not start his consulting work until after he left the DIA. The vetting he received prior to that role, which is what gave him his clearance would not have shown his ties to Turkey or Russia because that work hadn t happened yet.Members of the military are barred from working for foreign governments for life, unless they receive Congressional approval. The reason is that they can be called back to duty at any time and working for a foreign government could cause a conflict of interest.Featured image via Mark Makela/Getty Images.",News,"April 29, 2017"
 Golf Addicted 70-Year-Old Man Says He ‘Couldn’t Care Less About Golf’,"Just as drug addicts and alcoholics tend to be in denial of their disease, former reality show star Donald Trump does not think he has a problem. The alleged president has not addressed opioid addiction which is sweeping across the U.S., and that s probably because he, too, suffers from a type of addiction and remains in denial. Donald Trump needs treatment, but that would mean he d have to take a leave of absence from his job.The amateur president has spent 31 days of his time in office visiting at least one of his properties, including 19 visits to his golf clubs. He s been on the job for only 100 days. In contrast, former President Barack Obama only hit the golf course once during the same amount of time in office. Obama s first golf game was on April 26th, 2009.Still yet, as addicts do, Trump defended his frequent weekend trips to his luxury resort and properties, saying he does not care about golfing as much as people might think he does, according to The Hill. I have a lot of property. So if I go to my clubs like in New Jersey, they ll say,  Oh he is going to play golf.  I am not going to play golf,  Trump said in an interview on Fox News.  I couldn t care less about golf. Well, he sure did care when Obama played golf, though. In fact, there are dozens of rage-tweets from Trump about Obama playing golf.Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2014 But I have a place there that costs almost nothing because its hundreds of acres and security and they don t have to close up streets,  Trump added.What Trump means is that it costs him  nothing.  We, the taxpayers, though, are paying big time. It costs us about $3 million a pop every time he visits his Mar-a-Lago resort. Meanwhile, every visit to a Trump-owned property promotes it and that means there s a conflict of interest as he profits from the presidency.Trump did say that he feels  a little guilty  going back to his Trump Tower residence in New York because of all the expenses that are associated with each trip. But, he didn t mention the costs to taxpayers having to foot the bill for having several White Houses, instead of one. For example, the security for Melania Trump in New York reportedly costs the city s Police Department between $127,000 and $146,000 a day to protect her and her son. The Secret Service had to request an additional $60 million in funding to protect Trump and his family. I love New York, but going back is very expensive for the country because they close up Fifth Avenue and they close up 56th Street   and I always feel a little bit guilty when I go there,  he said.Trump said he does not want to be perceived as  lazy  but noted that he prefers to visit his other properties because they are not as expensive to secure. They are expensive to secure. Trump s frequent visits to his Florida resort have been a financial burden on the county. It would be much better if people would understand that I could go other places that I have,  Trump said.  But then they hit me for relaxing. And I don t want to be known as a person that relaxes because I am working hard and I am working hard for the people. Addiction, whether it be from drugs, alcohol, sex or golfing, is not a prejudiced disease. It can affect you whether you are black, white, Orange, rich or poor, pay your taxes, or if you try to hide your taxes from the public because you pay nothing at all.Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images.",News,"April 29, 2017"
 Bill Maher Just Dropped A Truth Bomb About Trump Voters That Every Liberal Needs To Hear (VIDEO),"We on the left are all wondering why, out of the vast field of GOP candidates, Donald Trump roared to the nomination, toppling traditional candidates like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and even hard-right bigots like Ted Cruz. No, they picked The Donald, and no matter how vulgar he was, how bigoted he was, how dangerously unhinged he was, they still picked him. Then, they got him elected president, to the horror of most Americans and to the delight of that swath of people who were so entranced by Trump from the moment he rode down that escalator.Well, now, we are 100 days in, and the Trump presidency is just as chaotic and terrifying as we all knew it would be. Trump is incompetent and dangerous, as well as an embarrassment on the world stage. Yet, his voters are sticking with him. And Bill Maher, host of HBO s Real Time, thinks he knows why. Remember when Trump said he could shoot someone in the middle of New York City s Fifth Avenue and not lose voters? That s likely true. And Maher has the answer as to why. He said in his  New Rules  segment on Friday night: Trump supporters aren t changing their minds because the problem isn t in the mind. It s lower. It s emotional. He could have Ann Frank s skeleton in his closet. They d all vote for him again. He continued, letting liberals know why facts, vulgarity, incompetence, and any other outrage Trump might commit matters not to his devoted followers: I think it s a gut feeling that the world has changed and they don t like it. Trump is going to change it back to the way it was. Maher then went on to mock Trump voters in a hillbilly affect, saying things like: I ain t no racist, but why does American need to have a black Santa Claus? And did I mention Bruce Jenner has tits now? Returning to his normal voice, Maher explained: I think I speak for most liberals when I say, I don t care about black Santa. I don t think it s going to make the Little Drummer Boy start cutting himself. But to Trump voters, making Santa black is unthinkable. It d be like making Jesus Middle Eastern. Maher concluded, summing up just why Trump voters put him in the White House, despite the fact that he is clearly the last person who should be president: This is why building that stupid wall is still a key issue for them. It represents keeping out not just immigrants but everything that is new and different and scary and unfamiliar. And this is just it. These people don t care what Trump does. He ll make America comfortable for them again, in their minds. There will be no more religions besides Christianity, there will be no LGBTQ rights, black people and other minorities will know their places, women would be in the kitchen and the bedroom where they belong rather than in the boardroom, and white men will control everything again.This is about cultural anxiety and bigotry. It really was, as Van Jones says, a white lash. Therefore, don t try and woo Trump voters away from him with facts. They seriously don t care.Watch Bill Maher s very important message below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 29, 2017"
" Desperate For Guests, Fox News’ O’Reilly Replacement Invites Fabio On To Bash Liberals (VIDEO)","Until today s episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight, this was widely considered the most pathetic thing to ever happen on Fox News:After today, this could very well be the next contender:Fabio: Releasing inmates early will lead to more crime. #Tucker pic.twitter.com/2PZeFb9Z3W  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017That would be male model Fabio spewing a word salad about liberals destroying California before getting sidetracked into a protracted rant about the legal system. Fabio has come to the conclusion that America s world record prison population is actually too small. Why is he an expert? His house was broken into once. Tucker Carlson treats Fabio s fact-free musings on criminality as sage advice. Fox News  social media team thought it was such a clever line that they went ahead and promoted it on Twitter.Things are not going well for Fox News.Tucker Carlson replaces Bill O Reilly after the Fox icon was fired for sexual misconduct that spanned decades. Tucker s show has so far managed to retain much of O Reilly s audience, but it s taken less than a week for things to start coming apart at the seams. By inviting disreputable guests like Fabio and Ann Coulter, Tucker has shown he ll aim to be more of a Sean Hannity than a serious newsman. Any chance that Fox News might try to clean itself up has already gone out the window.Sean Hannity, meanwhile, has become completely unglued since losing his boss Roger Ailes and his co-worker Bill O Reilly to sexual harassment violations. Already unstable, Hannity has lost the thread entirely. He s now the paranoid guy wearing a tinfoil hat on the bus.G be i pray this is NOT true because if it is, that's the total end of the FNC as we know it. Done. Best Sean https://t.co/W3BJ2wjzRD  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 27, 2017Somebody HIGH UP AND INSIDE FNC is trying to get an innocent person fired. And Gabe I KNOW WHO it is.

Stupid never learns.And then there is the pending lawsuit in which several black former Fox employees allege Fox executives made them armwrestle  for entertainment  along with other humiliating activities.According to the plaintiffs  attorneys, Slater demanded that black employees hold  arm wrestling matches  with white female employees in her office, just down the hall from Ailes s office on the 2nd floor of Fox headquarters.  Forcing a black woman employee to  fight  for the amusement and pleasure of her white superiors is horrifying. This highly offensive and humiliating act is reminiscent of Jim Crow era battle royals,  the letter says, referring to the practice of paying black men to fight blindfolded at carnivals for white spectators  entertainment.What a healthy environment Fox News has created for itself. No wonder they are struggling to find a celebrity more reputable than Fabio to come on their shows and shill for Trump.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Dem Senator Goes On HEARTWRENCHING Tweetstorm About Gun Violence During Trump’s NRA Speech,"Donald the Trump went to speak at the NRA s annual meeting today, and his speech was utterly ridiculous. He borrowed a lot of what he said from the rhetoric of an extreme right-wing, anti-government group known as the Three Percenters, including saying that there will be another revolution if the government finds ways to regulate guns.Because that s what the people from the group that donated $30 million to Trump s campaign want to hear. Whenever there s another violent tragedy and guns are involved, we get to hear all about how it happened because not enough people were armed, because it was a gun-free zone, etc. These people think nothing, care nothing, for the lives lost due to gun violence. And Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy has had it.So he went on a devastating tweetstorm today, complete with pictures of children and young adults who have died at the hands of senseless gun violence.

 Obama Just CRUSHED Trump’s Lies About His “Winning” Presidency In The BEST Way (DETAILS),"If there s one person that Donald Trump can t STAND to have criticizing him, it s his predecessor, Barack Obama   and Obama just attacked Trump in a way that was pretty damn genius.Last night, at a private event in Manhattan, the former POTUS reminded America of the amazing leader they lost when his second term was up. As Trump continuously blasts him and takes credit for the many accomplishments that he worked hard for, Obama reminded the audience just how resilient and successful Obamacare is   by pointing out that Obamacare now has a higher approval rating than the current president.According to CNN: As Republicans in Washington sputtered again this week in their efforts to undo the law, Obama noted to an audience in midtown Manhattan that  the Affordable Care Act has never been more popular   and it s more popular than the current president,  according to a person in the room who paraphrased the comments. We couldn t have thought of a better way to insult Trump and the Republican Party, especially as their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act continue to be a disastrous, embarrassing failure.Obamacare, which Trump repeatedly referred to as a  disaster  and  jobs killer , isn t going anywhere thanks to its popularity and the GOP s failure to do any better. Considering that Trump s approval ratings are at a historic low despite its honeymoon period, it s unlikely that any major piece of legislation that he tries to pass will be accepted.It s nice to see that after all the backlash and attacks from Trump and the Republican Party, Obama is reveling in his hard work. The knowledge that his health care bill could not be taken down so easily and is now more appreciated by Americans than the idiot who replaced him in the White House, must be satisfying as hell and Obama has earned the right to gloat about it.Featured image via Zach Gibson / Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Florida Student In Deep Sh*t After Trying To Sell Black Classmates Into Slavery On Craigslist,"Donald Trump hasn t even been President 100 days and already some are apparently forming the idea that it s cool to post slave sale ads on Craigslist.A Florida high school student snapped a photo of two of his African-American classmates sitting at their desks at Fleming Island High School. In a post geotagged to Fleming Island Plantation, a neighborhood in the town, the unnamed student posted an ad to Craigslist: Two healthy negro slavegals for sale. Good condition and hard work ethic! If you need another pair of hands around the farm/house, you re in luck!

I had friends texting and calling me,  senior Skye Fefee, one of the students in the photo, says.  Everyone started tagging me in the post, and then my mom saw it and was disturbed by it  I was really upset about it because Fleming Island is known for racial slurs. This school year someone wrote on the toilets,  whites only. The student who posted the ad was suspended for a meager ten days, but was referred to an alternative school by the principal. The school board will ultimately decide whether to remove the student, send him to alternative school permanently, or expel him.Superintendent Addison Davis issued a statement in response encouraging parents to take the time to inform their kids that it s not cool at all to sell your classmates into slavery: We do not tolerate this type of behavior and we are disheartened that any of our students would be subject to discrimination. Fleming Island High School administration and district leadership are working together to create a schoolwide plan of action to strengthen the climate and culture while celebrating the school s diversity. We encourage parents and guardians to take the time to talk to their child about this important matter. Feefee says she wants to see the person who posted this expelled, adding that the administration  doesn t pay attention  to this sort of behavior regularly.Donald Trump s election has allowed racists to express themselves as never before, as he has filled his administration with white supremacists, Nazis, and other assorted fascists, racists, and utter scumbags.What a great example for our kids.Watch a news report below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 28, 2017"
 WATCH: Jake Tapper Rips Michael Flynn for His Hypocrisy,"This has not been a good week for Michael Flynn. According to a letter from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) to the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Flynn never received permission to receive permission for the monies he was paid by both Russian and Turkish governments.The Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, article I, section 9, clause 8, as interpreted in Comptroller General opinions and by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, prohibits receipt of consulting fees, gifts, travel expenses, honoraria, or salary by all retired military personnel, officer and enlisted, regular and reserve, from a foreign government unless congressional consent is first obtained. Consent is provided by Congress under 37 U.S.C. 908, which requires advance approval from the relevant service secretary and the Secretary of State before accepting employment, consulting fees, gifts, travel expenses, honoraria, or salary from a foreign government.   Accordingly, if you are ever in a position where you would receive an emolument from a foreign government or from an entity that might be controlled by a foreign government, be sure to obtain advance approval from the Army prior to acceptance.  (emphasis in original)To recap: Flynn broke the law, lied about why he was fired and was never really vetted by the Trump administration prior to becoming the President s National Security Advisor. He says he was fired from the military because he called the enemies of the United States  jihadis.  The military says he was fired for not listening to orders, being abusive to staff and going against policy. He was warned in 2014 to not accept payments from Russia or Turkey but he went ahead and did it anyway.If you have any doubts as to why the Emoluments Clause is so important, you only have to read the op-ed Flynn wrote in November 2016 about Turkey. While he was on the Turkish payroll he wrote,  We need to adjust our foreign policy to recognize Turkey as a priority. We need to see the world from Turkey s perspective. The good news is Flynn is out of the administration. Now the Trump administration needs to release everything it used to vet him.Featured image via Kevin Hagen/Getty Images.",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Man Attacks Lexington Student With Machete For Not Being A Republican,"A student at Transylvania University was injured she was attacked by a man wielding a machete. The attacker, identified as Mitchell Adkins, entered a cafe on campus and started asking people what their political party affiliation was. In addition to the machete, he had a bag that was filled with knives. Mark Barnard, the police chief, said the victim was taken to the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. Classes at the university were cancelled for the rest of the day.Of the victim, Transylvania University President Seamus Carey said she  is safe and her family is with her at the University of Kentucky Hospital. Adkins, who may be a former student at the school, was also taken to the hospital to be evaluated. A guy came in, banged something, a hatchet or an ax, on the table and said  the day of reckoning has come. He asked somebody what their political affiliation was, they said  Republican  and the guy said  you are safe.  And then I realized what was going on and started getting people out,  said Tristan Reynolds, another student who was in the coffee shop at the time of the attack. He reported that there were between 30 and 40 people in the cafe at the time.  We started to scatter and then very, very quickly campus security was getting everybody sheltered and secure. They were very on it. The cafe is popular with students. They like to go there for breakfast and coffee, according to Reynolds, who is the editor of The Rambler, the Transylvania student paper. One thing that sets this cafe apart is its open floor plan.The coffee shop, which is inside the Glenn Building, has an open floor plan and is a popular spot for students to get coffee and breakfast, Reynolds said. He is the editor-in-chief of the Transylvania student newspaper, The Rambler, and was with other members of the paper s staff at the cafe at time of the attack.Lexington police, along with the security officers for the University of Transylvania, were given active shooter training a few weeks ago. This exercise also went onto how to lock down sites and the best way to keep students, faculty and staff safe. Seamus Carey, the president of the university said,  They ve always been amazing and today they proved their worth again. They were there immediately. They saved what could have been a much more disastrous situation and I d also like to commend the Lexington police for responding immediately as well. Adkins has a history of complaining about discrimination against conservatives. He wrote a letter to the student paper in which he said,  Being a Republican in this school makes me such a minority that I ve had to face discrimination on a daily basis. Transylvania is a predominantly Democratic school. I m always happy to listen to other people s opinions, but as soon as I give my own, I m called a  bigot,  an  a -le,  some even go as far as  fascist Nazi. ",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Watch Reporter’s Face As He Recounts Trump Going Full-Narcissist During Oval Office Interview (VIDEO),"On his 100th day in office, a listless Donald Trump sat down with Reuters to talk about his accomplishments. As fate would have it, Trump had just been told that two servicemembers had been killed in an anti-ISIS raid in Afghanistan, his re-re-remade healthcare bill was dead on arrival, and his plans to build a wall were going up in flames. But he had other things on his mind. For Donald Trump, every day is November 8th, 2016.To the three reporters, Trump passed out a printed picture of the United States, with counties he won in the election colored in red.More than five months after his victory and two days shy of the 100-day mark of his presidency, the election is still on Trump s mind. Midway through a discussion about Chinese President Xi Jinping, the president paused to hand out copies of what he said were the latest figures from the 2016 electoral map. Here, you can take that, that s the final map of the numbers,  the Republican president said from his desk in the Oval Office, handing out maps of the United States with areas he won marked in red.  It s pretty good, right? The red is obviously us. Later he posed for photos, insisting on holding up the map. (Note: Trump s White House photographer, who formerly worked in the Bush White House, likes to take pictures of Trump from really far away. It s unclear exactly why.)So this happened today  pic.twitter.com/UqtgvoyIRj  SalenaZito (@SalenaZito) April 28, 2017here's a pic from reuters of Trump with the electoral maps he showed to reporters yesterday pic.twitter.com/1X3edpeJDQ  Gideon Resnick (@GideonResnick) April 28, 2017Reporter Jeff Mason recounted the surreal moment the President of the United States interrupted questions on North Korea and China to brag about a map of the election he had won more than 5 months earlier. His expressions cycle from disbelief to pity to humor and back to disbelief.CNN s Chris Cuomo asked the reporters the obvious question: Is Trump really so insecure that he still feels he has to prove that he won the election? Mason said it could be a lot of factors (all troubling from a mental health standpoint): I think that s a good question and it s hard for me to answer that. I think he just wanted to relish in the fact that this map, uh, looks good for him and he said  the red is obviously us  and the red are areas in the country that he won. So he s just very proud of it. And whether that s rooted in a sense that he still has to prove that he won or that he s upset that the media got it wrong in terms of the predictions ahead of time it s hard for me to say. Trump, a 70-year-old billionaire, craves the attention one might give a child for a project they made in art class. He may as well have asked the reporters to pin the map up on their refrigerator doors.Making it even more clear that Trump is suddenly feeling very small, he later admitted that being president is really hard, and it s not as fun as his old life. The fact that running the country wouldn t be as easy as being a semi-retired billionaire and reality tv show host was something that apparently never occurred to Trump prior to being elected. I loved my previous life. I had so many things going. This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier. At least he s got his map.Featured image via CNN",News,"April 28, 2017"
" While Scott Baio’s Battle With Erin Moran’s Family Continues, His Wife Defends His ‘Size’","Erin Moran s family members must have really upset former  Happy Days  star Scott Baio and his wife because now Chachi s penis size is being defended.Trump fan Scott Baio weighed in on Moran s death, saying he was  not completely shocked  by his former co-star s death and added that if  you do drugs or drink, you re gonna die. I m sorry if that s cold, but God gave you a brain, gave you the will to live and thrive and you gotta take care of yourself. However, Moran died from cancer, not drugs. And Baio s ignorance about drug addiction is stunning.So, Moran s brother Tony and her cousin, Roy, wasn t too pleased. Baio was called a  d*ck head  and  a scumbag coward piece of shit! On Facebook, Tony Moran wrote:A special shout out to Scott Baio. I already went on Twitter about you. I hope it finds you. You and my lil sis had a very very brief fling. She dumped you. 2 reasons. 1. She told me that you were more like a lil girl and not a man. 2. She told me that you were tiny. Ya know. Barely a man in the man region. True story! Scott, I d advise you to get on your knees and pray you never run into me.In what The Daily Beast notes as an  inability to know when to maintain a dignified silence,  Renee Baio came to the defense of her husband s penis size.Renee tweeted,  Why would a sister tell her brother about the size of boyfriend s manhood? Creepy at best. SB was a playboy for a reason!  We took a screenshot knowing she might delete it or lock down her account and as a surprise to no one ever, her tweets are now protected.So now Mrs. Baio is calling Erin Moran  creepy.  When her defense of Chachi s penis size is, but he  was a playboy 4 a reason,  then she is bringing his manhood into question again. Sometimes silence is the better option. Chachi never grew up and he apparently married a child. Both of them are staunch Trump supporters, by the way. Chachi loves Trump. As for Renee, the E-list celebrity s wife, she s as much of an idiot as her husband. She s taken to Facebook to launch rants in defense of her husband by using homophobic slurs against a website then declaring that Scott has  more class in his piss than all of you all.

" Rich A**hole Ran For President Thinking It Would Be An ‘Easy’ Job, Gets HUMILIATED By Reality","Donald Trump seriously thought having the hardest job on Earth would be  easy.  LOL!After 100 days on the job, many of which Trump spent at his lavish Florida resort playing golf, Trump stated during an interview with Reuters that he thought the presidency would be an easy job that he could just sail through.Trump complained about how his current job requires him to do much more work than he is accustomed to doing and waxed nostalgic about his life before taking over the White House. I loved my previous life. I had so many things going,  Trump said.  This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier. This demonstrates just how woefully unprepared Trump was to become president. And it certainly shows.After all, Trump s administration has been a complete failure only three months in.His unconstitutional executive actions on immigration have been blocked by federal judges. His effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act went down in flames, much to the relief of millions of Americans. His environmental record is a disaster. He still denies science and is cutting funding to scientific agencies and organizations. He has alienated our allies while continuing to praise Russia and Putin. He is embroiled in an ever-growing scandal. And he has turned America into a laughingstock around the world.And that s just the tip of the iceberg as Trump threatens World War III over North Korea and a government shutdown looms because he refuses to negotiate with Democrats.The only president who has had an arguably worse first 100 days is William Henry Harrison and that s only because he died 30 days into his presidency. But at least he didn t embarrass the nation and destroy it from within.The fact is that being president is a tough job. It s also a lonely job. There s a reason why presidents go grey during their years in office. It s a stressful job. Every decision made affects the nation and the world. Maybe if Trump spent less time golfing, tweeting, and watching cable news he would know that being president means working with Congress, including Democrats. Instead, Trump would rather act like a dictator and just sign executive orders between tee times and whine when he doesn t get his way.Clearly, Trump doesn t know what hard work is.Featured Image: Tom Pennington/Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Team Trump Refuses to Turn Over Key Vetting Documents on Flynn,"What did he know and when did he know it? These iconic questions are swirling around President Donald Trump and his former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. With the new revelations that received money from both the Russian and Turkish governments, it appears Team Trump is either about as incompetent as many critics believe or liked Flynn enough to overlook clear violations of the U.S. Constitution and the law. The U.S. Constitution prohibits members of the military from taking any money from foreign governments. Despite this, Flynn registered as a foreign agent after he left the administration. No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States: and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state. Even retired members of the military can be called back at any time so it is important that there be no conflict of interest. As a lobbyist for Turkey, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, it is hard to see how Flynn could have anything but such a conflict. Both the Department of Defense and the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight are looking into Flynn. The problem is that Team Trump is refusing to turn over the documents they used to vet the former general.Congressman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) was not happy with this situation. The ranking member on that committee said,  I honestly do not understand why the White House is covering up for Michael Flynn. It makes the American people think the White House has something to hide. There is obviously a paper trail that the White House does not want our committee to follow. For its part, the Department of Defense s inspector general is looking into Flynn s association with Russia and Turkey. He had been warned by the agency against taking these payments.The White House has had several explanations for why it is not turning over what they used to vet Flynn. They claim they do not have anything that was used before January 20. They then claim that the documents they have are  too sensitive  to turn over. When all of that didn t work, they fell back on an old standby. They blamed President Obama. The Obama administration fired Flynn.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said this,  My only point is that when General Flynn came into the White House he had an active security clearance issued during the Obama administration with all of the information that s being discussed that occurred in 2015. So, I guess my only point is to explain how the process works and who adjudicated that. After Flynn was fired, Trump stood by him calling Flynn  a good man  and blaming the media for his departure from the administration. Flynn says he told Team Trump of his dealings with Turkey. It seems they knew about what Flynn was doing and just didn t understand how serious it was and what the implications for our national security are. It will be impossible to know without a subpoena.Featured image via Mark Makela/Getty Images.",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Seth Meyers Torches Trump’s NAFTA Flip-Flop With Awesomely Dirty Joke (VIDEO),"Late Night host Seth Meyers regularly has a high old time making fun of the incompetence of Donald Trump and his administration during his  A Closer Look  monologues. On Thursday night, the subject was Trump s complete position change on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). During the campaign, Trump had repeatedly called NAFTA a  disaster,  but all it took was a couple of phone calls from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to get Trump to decide that the trade deal wasn t so bad after all.Meyers made fun of the whole thing by returning to his jokes prior to Trump s election, saying many of them are now reality, starting with: If we elect Trump we re going to end up fighting with Canada! Ha! Thanks to Trump s earlier threats to rip up NAFTA, Canada s  softwood lumber  exports became a hot topic. This was a golden opportunity for Meyers, who insisted there would be no jokes about male anatomy, but then he proceeded to make them anyway, saying: I m just saying that Donald Trump does not want to be slapped with soft-Canadian wood so he s clamping down on it. Meyers then went all in on the idea that Canada is deliberately axing prices of soft lumber   a process he referred to as  stumpage.  He continued: This is all very confusing for Trump because  stumpage  is his nickname for Donald Jr. As for the overall defeat of Trump s NAFTA termination promise? That was the best joke of all, when Meyers ended with a total zinger: Something tells me this isn t the first time Trump has had to pull out because of soft wood. HaHa, probably not. Then again, that s why he and all of those other old GOP men insist that health insurance always includes Viagra coverage.Watch the mockery below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Courts Decide Conspiracy Nut Alex Jones Is Too Crazy To Raise His Own Kids (DETAILS),"Alex Jones of the conspiracy theory website Infowars has made a literal career of spreading fake news and acting like a lunatic. It now seems that said career has come back to really bite him in the ass, since Jones just lost a court battle with his wife regarding which parent is most fit to raise their children. After more than nine hours of considering the merits of Jones  case, a jury returned, giving the estranged couple joint custody of the three children. Despite having joint custody, though, Jones  ex, Kelly Jones, will have most of the power.Prior to this battle, Alex Jones had the kids living with him, with their mother s rights being severely curtailed. She was only allowed supervised visits before. The reasons for this are unclear. She said tearfully to the press: I m so blessed to have such a wonderful support system and I just pray that what s happened to my family that people can understand what parental alienation syndrome is and get an awareness of it so we can stop this from happening to others. A lawyer for Kelly Jones, Robert Hoffman, said of Alex Jones: Mr. Jones is like a cult leader. And we ve seen the horrific damage cult leaders do to their followers. Indeed he is. Alex Jones whips his paranoid, ignorant followers up into a frenzy and makes them believe all kinds of tomfoolery. He has promoted the idea that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting never happened, that 9/11 was actually carried out by the United States government, and all kinds of other craziness, and his rabid audience believes every word of it. Definitely, such a person should not be influencing children.  At any rate, it is good to see that jury made the right choice here, and hopefully Kelly Jones can undo whatever damage her estranged husband did to those poor children.Featured image via screen capture from Infowars",News,"April 28, 2017"
 Trump Put An American Flag On His Birthday Tweet To Melania – There’s Just ONE Problem (TWEETS),"It seems that Donald Trump is often incapable of avoiding really stupid, but public, mistakes on Twitter. Oftentimes those are spelling errors, and sometimes they re factual errors, but sometimes they re just bizarre.

In addition, three other states were added to the Union in 1890.

" After Pepsi Botched Its Ad Campaign, Heineken Gets Theirs Exactly Right (VIDEO)","A few weeks ago, Pepsi decided to try to bridge the racial divide with what someone must have thought was a great idea. They ran an ad featuring Kendall Jenner, who, in the ad, tried to show police and African-Americans that their lives matter by letting a cop drink Pepsi.Here it is:The internet hated it (which might have been the point):Within 48 hours the video got nearly 1.6 million views on YouTube (five times as many downvotes as upvotes), and Twitter and Facebook lit up with people pointing out just how gauche the whole thing was. Activist DeRay Mckesson called it  trash,  adding  If I had carried Pepsi I guess I never would ve gotten arrested. Who knew?  People made memes (some even reaching back and evoking Pepper Spray Cop). And, rightfully, many folks pointed out that using protest imagery in order to peddle soda particularly images that evoked the photo of Ieshia Evans facing down police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana last year was pretty tasteless. It was one of the few times the internet ever agreed on anything.Source: WiredWhether in response to Pepsi s ad that never should have been, or whether this began organically, Heineken beer had their own version of an ad that addresses the political divide, but they got it right.In an experiment, they had complete strangers who would hate each other under normal circumstances, and put them in situations that created bonding.

" Paul Ryan BREAKS DOWN, Admits GOP’s Trumpcare Bill Is A Massive Failure (VIDEO)","The Republican Party has had it rough. Not only have they had to admit that their presidential candidate, Donald Trump, is an absolute nut job who can t do anything right, but their attempt to replace Obamacare has been just as much of a failure.The GOP has spent several years whining and moaning about how they would like to replace Obama s Affordable Care Act, despite the fact that a majority of Americans are in favor of keeping it. But once they finally had their chance to prove they could do better with Trump in the White House, they blew it.Recently at his weekly press conference, House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked if the House would vote on Trumpcare before Trump reached his first 100-day marker. Ryan s response was nothing short of absolute defeat and despair as he admitted that the GOP s horrible healthcare bill didn t have enough votes to pass. Ryan said: We want to go when we re ready to go. This has been a very organic bottom up process. It takes time to do that. We re doing big things, and you know me, I talked about 200 days because I thought the kind of agenda we re attempting to put together here overhauling health care, overhauling the tax system, rebuilding our military, securing the border. Those take more than just a few months. They take a long time, at least a year, so that s why we re working on the path to get it right, and not constrain it to some artificial deadline. What Ryan gave was a lot of excuses, along with his admission that he can t pass Trumpcare because there aren t enough votes to support a disastrous bill that would strip millions of Americans of their life-saving health insurance. It s entirely possible that the GOP will never have enough votes to make Trumpcare a thing, and Ryan s words are just as much empty promises as Trump s are.You can watch Ryan admit defeat below:Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"April 27, 2017"
 Beyond Parody: Sean Spicer Blames Obama For Trump Hiring Foreign Agent Michael Flynn (VIDEO),"With questions mounting, Sean Spicer finally found an answer as to why Donald Trump hired known foreign agent and possible criminal Michael Flynn to be his National Security Advisor: It s Obama s fault.The Trump White House came up with their excuse seemingly overnight. Prior to Spicer s comments, the administration flailed for months. Meanwhile, Flynn s actions and Trump s cover up of them have swelled into a firestorm. Reporters have discovered that the now-fired Flynn was working for the Turkish government while on Trump s campaign, that Flynn told Trump s team that he was engaged in this illegal activity, and that the Pentagon had warned Flynn to cut it out as early as 2014.Former national security adviser Michael Flynn was warned by the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 against accepting foreign payments as he entered retirement, according to new documents obtained by the House oversight committee.A final nail in Flynn s coffin when it was learned that he was also accepting money from RT, the state-sponsored television station which largely operates as a propaganda tool for the Russian government. Flynn hid these payments, adding an additional level of wrongdoing.None of which stopped Trump from hiring Flynn as his top military advisor, defending him for weeks, then ultimately saying he didn t think Flynn had done anything wrong despite his resignation. Trump, who once boasted that he only hired the best people, has predictably decided to blame Obama rather than accept responsibility. A sad pattern that he leans on for many of his failings.Asked about Mike Flynn s vetting by the Trump team, Spicer blames the Obama admin. for renewing Flynn s security clearance years before pic.twitter.com/iPkuxA7uCu  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) April 27, 2017Spicer:General Flynn was a career military officer who maintained a high level security clearance throughout his career in the military. His clearance was last reissued by the Obama administration in 2016 with full knowledge of his activities.Spicer overlooks the fact that the military actually forced Flynn out in disgrace that same year for being  disruptive  and a warmonger who didn t listen to his superiors. He also overlooks that Trump, who by then knew of Flynn s history, decided to hire him as a full-time surrogate for his campaign, host him at the RNC (where Flynn led  lock her up  chants), then promoted him to National Security Advisor once elected.Trump is a natural born scam artist but this desperate stab at passing the buck will be a hard sell even to his most ardent supporters.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 27, 2017"
 Fox News Host Jesse Watters Takes ‘Vacation’ After Disgusting Comments About Ivanka Trump,"Remember when Bill O Reilly took a vacation after his sexual harassment payoffs went public? Well, let s hope Jesse Watters  vacation is permanent, too.Watters is a product of Bill O Reilly s former Fox News program. The racist and sexist segments known as Watters  World often targeted specific groups in a sick and twisted version of right-wing  humor. From there, Watters was promoted as a guest host and just days after beginning a full-time gig on The Five, he is already taking time off after making a crude oral sex joke about Ivanka Trump on the air.While discussing Trump being jeered and booed in Germany for hypocritically talking about empowerment of women, Watters complained about liberals attacking Ivanka and characterized those attacks as anti-women even though what liberals are criticizing for is her blatant hypocrisy. Ivanka claims to be a champion for women s rights but stands idly by while her father signs executive orders reducing protections for women. In short, she is complicit by staying silent.Anyway, Watters couldn t control himself and ended up making a sex joke about Ivanka only days after Bill O Reilly was fired for sexual harassment. And his joke came just after whining about how liberals are supposedly  disrespecting  women by booing Ivanka. I really like the way she is speaking into that microphone,  Watters said while gesturing with his hands, implying that he s talking about oral sex.Here s the video via YouTube.Watters later tried to cover his ass by claiming that he was merely talking about her voice. On air I was referring to Ivanka s voice and how it resonates like a smooth jazz radio DJ,  Watters wrote.  This was in no way a joke about anything else. Viewers of Watters  words and actions drew sharp criticism, especially from conservative writer John Podheretz, who referred to Watters as a  disgusting creep. You are so full of shit it s coming out your ears, you disgusting creep. https://t.co/1cnrfc8rDC  John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) April 26, 2017And now Watters is going on a  vacation  for the rest of the week.Again, Watters was only on his third day on the job as a full-time host of The Five and he couldn t control himself from making a crude sex joke about a woman. He demonstrated perfectly that the sexist environment at Fox News has not changed at all. It s merely been taken over by younger frat boys.If Fox News is serious about changing the culture at their network, they should make sure Watters stays on  vacation.

 Trump Administration Admits That Latest Executive Order Was Nothing But An Empty Photo Op (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is quickly closing in on his first 100 days in office, and despite his many, many promises of accomplishments during this presidential milestone, he s accomplished zilch other than a handful of executive orders that would help make America and the world a living stinkhole. So what does Trump, whose ever and only a showman do? He holds photo ops, where he holds up oversized documents to show off his cartoonish signature.His latest executive order was the type of empty photo op you d expect from a game show host, not from a president, because it literally did nothing. It was supposed to empower education secretary, Betsy DeVos to screw with Washington, D.C. public schools in much the same way as Trump is allowing oil companies to screw with our environment. Why just D.C.? Because they are the only school district within the purview of the federal government and not the states. So, every time Republicans want to bully people of color, they go after Washington, D.C. Fortunately for the school children, though, this executive order was about as toothless as the average Fox News viewer, as Senior Department of Education official Rob Goad admitted:Q You said at the top that this executive order would empower the Secretary to modify or get rid of any regulations that don t comply with law. How will that process work?MR. GOAD: So I think at the end of 300 days, and after we have produced a report, we will make those decisions once the report has concluded.Q So is she empowered to modify the regulations as needed, or is that going to be a separate process entirely?MR. GOAD: The executive order gives her   empowers her to modify anything that is inconsistent with federal law.Q Isn t she already empowered to do those things? This executive order doesn t give her those powers, right?MR. GOAD: That s right.Source: ShareBlueThat, apparently, was too much transparency for the administration. Goad was prompted to shut down the press conference right after that question.",News,"April 27, 2017"
 Americans TORCH Hypocrite GOP Lawmaker For Using Affordable Care Act To Get Major Surgery Before Leaving Office,"Donald Trump and the Republican Congress are busy trying to shred healthcare for the rest of us, but one Republican lawmaker is using Obamacare to get major surgery before he leaves office.Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz has been outspoken about the Republican effort to kill the Affordable Care Act. He s been salivating at doing so for years. He calls it a failed program that has done nothing but hurt the American people.But while he s busy trying to repeal the landmark healthcare law, he has no problem using it himself.Earlier this month, Chaffetz announced that he would not seek re-election after his current term expires. However, he s going to make sure he sucks as much healthcare out of American taxpayers as he can before he officially leaves.Chaffetz posted a message to Facebook on Wednesday night informing his constituents that he will be getting major surgery on his foot and will be taking the next 3-4 weeks offChaffetz seriously expects us to understand and give a damn about his situation. The problem is that he lacks sympathy and empathy when it comes to ordinary Americans who can t afford such surgeries and the amount of recovery time required.And if Republicans succeed at killing the Affordable Care Act, Americans will be at serious risk of not having health insurance to cover such medical procedures.Chaffetz, on the other hand, is using his gold level health insurance under the Affordable Care Act to cover his surgery. So he is literally using the Affordable Care Act to make sure his healthcare needs are met, and after he has no further use for it he ll vote to kill the law for everyone else.Americans were not happy about this hypocrisy, so they stormed Chaffetz s Twitter page and hammered him for it.@jasoninthehouse And you re going to use this as a teachable moment as to why coverage for pre-existing conditions and paid health leave is important, yes?

" White House Staffer Admits, “This S***’s Hard” As The Trump Administration Faces Steep Learning Curve","It is no secret that President Donald Trump et al had no idea what they were getting into when they took over the White House in January. Despite announcing,  In theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly,  (he made this comment last November) Team Trump seems barely able to find their way to work every day. As the 100 day mark looms, it seems White House staffers are starting to get the enormity of the job.Politico interviewed numerous people within the administration to get their take on how things are going within the administration. Perhaps one aide put it best when he said this,  I kind of pooh-poohed the experience stuff when I first got here but this shit is hard. For his part, Trump does not seem to understand the scope of some of his failures, such as with health care reform or his inability to have any major legislation passed but it looks like the people around him are starting to get it. They are in a tough spot. They have to do their jobs to the best of their ability but are hampered by a president who refuses to give up any of his free time and puts more stock in opinions he sees on cable news than what he gets in his security briefings.This has forced Trump s aides to change their tactics. One high level official told Politico, You don t walk in with a traditional presentation, like a binder or a PowerPoint. He doesn t care. He doesn t consume information that way. You go in and tell him the pros and cons, and what the media coverage is going to be like. One big hurdle White House staffers face is how to control Trump. One person who is close to the administration said,  It s not like the White House doesn t have a plan to fill his time productively but at the end of the day he s in charge of his schedule. He does not like being managed. Despite the possibility that the White House staffers are more aware of the challenges they face, some upsetting facts remain. Many high level positions remain unfilled. Neither Secretary of State Rex Tillerson nor Secretary of Defense James Mattis have deputies. Most ambassadorships are empty. The problem is not just that Team Trump doesn t know how to deal with Congress, it s that they simply do not know how to govern.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 27, 2017"
 WATCH: The Simpsons Brutally Parodies Trump’s First 100 Days,"The long running cartoon, The Simpsons, will offer its take on President Donald Trump s first 100 days in office. In this clip, he is depicted counting up all of his accomplishments while sitting in bed. What are they? He has  lowered my gold handicap  and  added 700 new Twitter followers.  The clip also shows him replacing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg with his daughter, Ivanka.The show is not only the longest running animated series on television; it is the longest running prime time program with a script. It first aired on December 12, 1988.Politics has been a common theme on the show. The Simpsons predicted a Trump presidency. Back in 2000, the show had Lisa Simpson taking over from a President Trump. Their take on the impact such a thing would have on the country was not good as Lisa was going to  focus on the the R s; reading, writing and refilling the oceans.

 Dem Lawmaker Out-Trolls Internet Troll By Calling His Grandmother (IMAGE),"The Internet can be a vicious place and an openly gay lawmaker has gotten used to being the recipient of homophobic slurs. On Wednesday morning, Pennsylvania House Rep. Brian Sims woke up to find a message on his Facebook page which read,  N**ger faggot.  There wasn t much information on the troll s Facebook page. What caught me about it was there wasn t a reference to something I said or something I d done or some policy,  Sims told the Huffington Post.  And when I looked at his page there was very little there   but he d posted a telephone number a number of times. At 6:15 a.m. Sims decided to call the number and the woman who answered the phone turned out to be the troll s grandmother. You ve all seen the  Brave keyboard warrior sitting in Mom s basement eating a hot pocket sandwich  type meme but this was real life. I explained to her exactly who I as and what he had done,  Sims said.  Like any grandma she was very embarrassed at having this kind of convo and very ashamed at the actions of her grandson. The conversation ended with me telling her that I wanted to hear from him. Sims did speak to the troll but he said that the conversation  didn t resolve anything. It is the ultimate calling card of a coward to   under the guise of night and behind a keyboard   use the kind of language that in person would cause most decent people to respond in anger and frustration,  Sims said.  The reason people do things like this is they don t have the courage, the education or gumption to do this kind of thing in person. At the top of Sims  Facebook page, it now reads:Dear Bigots, posting your grandmother s telephone number all over the same page you use to post slurs on other people s pages is not going to end well for you.

BrianPublicado por Brian Sims em Quarta, 26 de abril de 2017Rep. Sims was nice enough to blur out the troll s last name, leaving only  David  to identify him with even though when the bigot left the message, he proudly displayed his name, leaving his grandma s phone number behind to track him down with.The post has gone viral with over 10,000 likes. Trolls, do not mess with Rep. Sims. He will call your grandma.The troll should have read Sims  post alongside his Facebook picture. The post left the day after the U.S. presidential election reads,  Too strong to be pushed back into the closet. Too experienced to lose our way. Too battle tested to give up now. Too much at stake to throw up our hands. Too right to be wrong. Testify!Image via Facebook. ",News,"April 27, 2017"
 Trump Set Up An Alien Crime Hotline And It Went Exactly Like You’re Thinking Right Now (TWEETS),"Recently, Donald Trump became the second major elected leader in history to publish a newsletter focusing on crimes committed by a segment of the population he wanted to demonize   Adolf Hitler with  The Criminal Jew  (a regularly published list of crimes allegedly committed by Jews) and Donald Trump with his Weekly and Declined Detainer Outcome Report, a regular publication of crimes allegedly committed by immigrants. The word  allegedly is important here, because Trump s list so far has been mostly Latinos who are accused but have not been convicted of anything at all.Trump decided that a newsletter attacking all immigrants because some allegedly have committed crimes (at a much lower rate than the rest of us), so he established VOICE   an entire department committed to criminalizing the Jews immigrants. While Trump set up a hotline for VOICE in an effort to give people an outlet for engaging this bigoted right-wing fantasy that immigrants are all criminals, he was in for a shock when people started calling. They called 1-855-48-VOICE about aliens, all right   just not the ones he wanted them to call about.Trumps   VOICE  Hotline set up for people to report on crime from illegal aliens was reportedly overloaded with calls about space aliens  Robbie Gramer (@RobbieGramer) April 26, 2017Trump wants you to report ""bad aliens"", so join me in complaining about the Hutt criminal organization in the Outer Rim: 1-855-48-VOICE.

If you have seen any strange alien activity   especially criminal   you should call. Whether you or a friend were abducted or probed, have seen crop circle-based vandalism, or witnessed livestock being turned inside out, it is your duty as a patriotic American to speak out.The number once again is 1-855-48-VOICE.

 Trump Considers ‘Terminating NAFTA’ With Executive Order (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order that would pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) unless they are willing to renegotiate with him for a better deal.This is what Trump had to say about NAFTA during his recent word salad of an interview with the Associated Press earlier this week.AP: What about NAFTA? What s the plan on NAFTA?TRUMP: What would you like to know?AP: I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating.TRUMP: I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don t even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.AP: Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal?TRUMP: I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.AP: Termination is still on the table.TRUMP: Absolutely. If they don t treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.AP: What s a timeline for that decision?TRUMP: It s a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, it s a six-month clause.CNN reported today that two senior administration officials had confirmed that Trump is debating withdrawing the U.S. from NAFTA through an executive order. The White House is currently mulling an executive order declaring the US  intent to withdraw from NAFTA, a move that could trigger a renegotiation of the trade pact rather than outright withdrawal,  the officials told CNN.This isn t a new stance for Trump, who railed against NAFTA throughout his campaign. In June, Trump declared that NAFTA was  the worst trade deal in  the history of this country. I m going to tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal by a lot, not just a little, by a lot for our workers. And if they don t agree to a renegotiation, which they might not, because they re so used to having their own way not with Trump, they won t have their own way then I will submit under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal,  Trump declared to his rabid supporters last summer.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2017"
" After Being Handed Yet Another Court Loss, Trump Threatens Revenge In Pure Dictator Style","Donald Trump hates losing. Not because it s a loss to his agenda, or a perceived loss to the American people. Trump hates losing because it hurt his paper thin ego and when he does lose, there s hell to pay (or at least threatened hell to pay). Trump suffered another major loss in court after a 9th Circuit Court judge ruled against his attempt at defundng sanctuary cities. Now, like a true dictator, Trump wants to break up the 9th Circuit.In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Trump said about breaking up the court: Absolutely, I have,  Trump said of considering 9th Circuit breakup proposals during a far-ranging interview with the Washington Examiner at the White House.  There are many people that want to break up the 9th Circuit. It s outrageous. He then accused liberal plaintiffs of court shopping for a more sympathetic body. Everybody immediately runs to the 9th Circuit. And we have a big country. We have lots of other locations. But they immediately run to the 9th Circuit. Because they know that s like, semi-automatic,  Trump said.The 9th Circuit, which covers nine western states and Guam, is based in San Francisco. San Francisco is, of course, one of the sanctuary cities, so plaintiffs didn t have go far to land on their docket.While the 9th has had some liberal rulings:Covering a huge swath of territory   nine western states plus Guam   the San Francisco-based court handles far more cases than any other federal appeals court, including some rulings that have invoked furor from conservatives over the years. Among them: finding that the phrase  under God  in the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional, that the  don t ask, don t tell  policy on gays in the military was problematic long before President Barack Obama s administration ended it, and that states can force pharmacies to dispense emergency contraceptives.Source: Mercury NewsThey are far more balanced than right-wingers would let on.But some legal scholars say the 9th Circuit s liberal reputation is overblown and that the court has moved to the middle as some of President Jimmy Carter s appointees   who were considered extremely liberal   have taken semi-retired  senior  status or passed away. A Democratic Congress nearly doubled the number of judges on the court during Carter s tenure, and his appointees faced easy confirmation in the Senate.President George W. Bush appointed six of the court s 25 active judges, but 18 have been appointed by Democrats, though the seven appointed by President Barack Obama are generally considered moderate, said University of Richmond Law School Professor Carl Tobias.Still, conservatives, and especially Trump, would like nothing more than to make California even less relevant in national politics (a vote in California is worth less than 1/3 of a vote in Wyoming).The bigger picture behind Trump s threat is far more disturbing. We have three (supposedly) co-equal branches of government. Trump is trying to use his executive powers to shut down any dissenting views, even from another branch. Even if you are a Trump voter, you should find this very disconcerting.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.",News,"April 26, 2017"
 Republican GOES OFF On Trump’s Border Wall In STUNNING No-Holds-Barred Rant (VIDEO),"Out of all the ridiculous, misguided ideas that have come up during his first 100 days, Donald Trump s border wall is definitely one of the least popular ones. Trump s border wall has not only been rejected by the majority of the American people, but politicians   even Republicans   are still strongly resisting the wall.Earlier today, Will Hurd (R-TX) went on Fox Business News to blast Trump and his beloved wall, unleashing a surprising and shocking rant that perfectly sums up why this border wall should not be created under any circumstances. Clearly stating that Trump s border wall is extremely ineffective and will cost way too much money, Rep. Hurd said: I ve been pretty clear on this idea of a wall, building a wall from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security.I spent nine and a half years as an undercover officer in the CIA chasing terrorists all over the world, nuclear weapons proliferators. And I have 820 miles of the border, more border than any other member of Congress. We need to be using additional technology and more manpower on the border you can t have a one size fits all solution for the border. Trump s border wall had come under fire recently as the incompetent POTUS tried to bully lawmakers into funding his wall before the government was forced to shut down. Trump s wall is going to be a disaster for U.S. taxpayers, considering that Trump refuses to accept the fact that Mexico isn t going to pay for the wall, or reimburse the United States like Trump says they will.Thankfully, there are at least some Republicans who understand what a disaster this border wall is. You can watch Hurd rip Trump and his wall apart below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2017"
 WATCH: Sean Spicer’s Debut in “The Bold and the Babbling” Is Everything You Expect And More,"President Donald Trump has made one thing clear, he cares about ratings more than anything else in the world. This week the Washington Post reported that when asked if he was planning firing Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary Trump said,  I m not firing Sean Spicer. That guy gets great ratings. Everyone tunes in. The President went on to compare the daily White House briefing to a soap opera and noted that Spicer gets better ratings than the soaps that are on today. Trump s love of television is so well known that aides use it as a way to reach him and foreign leaders are even starting to do the same. They are finding ways to show up on the shows they think the president is most likely to watch.Stephen Colbert took advantage of the comments connecting Spicer to soap operas to create one of his own.

" WATCH: Joe Scarborough Gets MOCKED For Comparing Ivanka To RFK, He Doesn’t Respond Well AT ALL","Joe Scarborough is not having the best morning.

This led Scarborough to compare President Donald Trump s daughter, Ivanka, to a Robert F. Kennedy.Scarborough said that having Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, working for him in the West Wing created the same kind of situation that upset so many Republicans during the Kennedy administration. When Host Mika Brzezinski questioned that logic, Scarborough did not take it well.Scarborough s rant went like this,  You don t have to be so snotty. I was about to say, you didn t let me get it out. You don t have to be so rude. The fact of the matter is that they are not Bobby Kennedy as I was about to say but you wanted to get your cheap shot in so you got your cheap shot in.

 WATCH: Republican House Oversight Chair Literally Blamed Obama For Trump’s Michael Flynn Scandal,"Republicans have apparently reached a new level of desperation to clear Donald Trump of all wrongdoing in his Russia scandal.Donald Trump chose Michael Flynn to work on his campaign. Donald Trump chose Michael Flynn to be his National Security Adviser. Donald Trump ignored the warnings about Michael Flynn. But somehow, Republicans are blaming President Obama anyway.As we all know, Flynn had dealings with Russia that he failed to disclose, including conversations with Russian officials about the sanctions placed by President Obama in retaliation against Russia for interfering in our national election.Flynn s ties to Russia run deep and one would think that Trump would have vetted Flynn. After all, Trump had plenty of time to do so during the campaign and after taking office.But he appointed Flynn anyway and even voiced his support of his National Security Adviser until the very end when Trump was forced to boot him out the White House.President Harry Truman once said that  The buck stops here  in reference to the fact that anything that happens during a president s tenure is the ultimate responsibility of the president.But Trump has done everything he can in an effort to escape any and all responsibility for what happens under his watch or lack thereof.And even Republicans have been making excuses to absolve him of any wrongdoing.That includes openly blaming President Obama for Trump s Flynn scandal.During an appearance on MSNBC on Tuesday, House Oversight Committee Chair Jason Cheffetz literally claimed that President Obama is at fault for this scandal. It was the Obama White House that this would have fallen under,  Chaffetz told Greta Van Susteran.  I don t think what happened here is really the fault of Donald Trump. Here s the video via VidMe.According to Cheffetz, the Obama administration is at fault because they vetted Flynn before he was appointed by Obama to head the Defense Intelligence Agency.However, prior to getting caught dealing with Russia earlier this year, Flynn had kept his ties to Russia under the radar. Those ties became much clearer after he got busted. Besides, Trump is the one responsible for hiring Flynn during the campaign and he is the one responsible for appointing him as National Security Adviser. Trump and his administration had lots of time to vet Flynn.So this falls directly and completely on Donald Trump. He had months to dig into Flynn s history, and clearly, he liked what he found. After all, they share a love of Putin and Russia in common.Cheffetz should just go ahead and resign immediately rather than serve out the remainder of his term. One would think that Cheffetz would feel free to do the right thing since he has chosen not to run for re-election. But it s apparent that he intends to lie and cover for Trump until the end. He should be ashamed.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 26, 2017"
 PAY-TO-PLAY: Ivanka Uses Official Europe Trip To Beg For Donations,"If Hillary Clinton were in the White House and she hired her daughter, Chelsea, to work in the West Wing and then let her fundraise for the Clinton Foundation, the GOP House would be drawing up Articles of Impeachment. That is exactly what is happening in President Donald Trump s White House. First daughter, Ivanka, is currently in Germany representing him. She works in the West Wing and is one of the main people the President listens to.Many have been wondering what Ivanka has been up to in her job at the White House. Now at least some of her time can be accounted for. She has set up a fund to help female entrepreneurs and has been soliciting funds from foreign countries. Axios is reporting that several have already donated. They include several Middle East countries.Axios is also reporting that her father is a big supporter of the idea. This is curious, given the President s problems with the Clinton Foundation, which also did a lot of good work and asked for money from foreigners and foreign governments. Trump and others brought up the idea that donations were made in order to gain access to the then Secretary of State. During the campaign, he went as far as to call the Clinton Foundation a  criminal enterprise. Trump told FOX News  Chris Wallace,  Saudi Arabia given $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women s rights? These are people that push gays off business, off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly and yet you take their money. So I d like to ask you right now why don t you give back the money that you ve taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? It is hard to see any difference between what Trump accused Hillary of doing and what his daughter is doing now. It s going to be interesting seeing how White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tries to explain this one.Featured image via Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2017"

My thing is, I feel bad because her whole life, she was troubled, could never find what made her happy and content,  Baio said on a radio show.  For me, you do drugs or drink, you re gonna die. Baio had zero evidence of the circumstances behind Moran s death, so he should have kept quiet until the official cause was released. As it turns out, Moran died after a battle with cancer.Baio s baseless speculation angered her grieving fans, but especially pissed off her family members, who took to social media to roast Baio alive.

I m sure they re attacking me because I m a conservative,  Baio remarked.  These people never attack the press for getting the story wrong about heroin. They attack me. Well, Tony Moran wasn t impressed. In fact, he called Baio out for being a coward after Baio had his wife call him to apologize instead of doing it himself.#scottbaio. Your wife contacts me? Not u?

She dumped you. 2 reasons. 1. She told me that you were more like a lil girl and not a man. 2. She told me that you were tiny. Ya know. Barely a man in the man region. True story! Scott, I d advise you to get on your knees and pray you never run into me.Well guys. Guess what? I was contacted by Scott Baio s wife. His wife! Fucking coward! I ve never met her. I do know the scumbag piece of shit Scott Baio tho. He was a piece of shit back then and still is. He had his wife contact me! Very apologetic and shit. Doesn t surprise me. It s too late you motherfucking pieces of shit! Go back under the rock you crawled out from under. There isn t one word I want to hear you speak. Makes me sick to my stomach.Scott Baio openly admitted in his Facebook post that he speculated on Erin Moran s cause of death only to find out that she had stage 4 cancer later on. He should have just personally apologized for his own words and actions rather than blaming the media. He knew damn well that an official cause of death had not been released yet. And he certainly should have spoken to Moran s brother personally instead of having his wife do it. Instead of handling Moran s death like a human being, Baio acted like a cowardly douchebag and he s getting the criticism he deserves.

" Caitlyn Jenner Slams Trump, Considers Running for Office","Caitlyn Jenner is not afraid to speak her mind. The Olympian turned reality TV star is making news once again. This week, while promoting her new book,  The Secrets of My Life,  she admitted that while she is a Republican and voted for President Donald Trump she is not happy with all of the president s policies and actions.Jenner spoke to a packed audience at the 92nd Street Y Community Center in New York this week. She says that she is looking into where her voice can be heard the loudest and how she can do the most to impact her community. She says that she does not regret voting for the president but she is not thrilled with everything has done. In the past she has said that she is a Republican because she supports  the Constitution and limited government. While she says that she has no regrets about voting for the president, Jenner admits,  As far as LGBT issues, yes, he s made some mistakes. I don t support him in everything that he does. But we needed to shake the system up. At the same time, Jenner said,  My loyalties are not with Donald Trump. I will come after him and come after Republicans if they come after my community. I ve got a voice and they better listen, OK? I will come after them. When a member of the audience asked if she had any plans to run for elected office, Jenner replied,  Would I be better working from the inside? If that is the case   I would seriously look at a run. It just depends where I could be more effective. Some people know Jenner from her time as Bruce when she won multiple gold medals in the Olympics during the 1970s. Younger generations know her from the show  Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  Viewers watched her before her transformation, through the process and then after. The family has not responded well to her new book.Before she told the world that she was transgender, Jenner thought she had  too many skeletons  in her closet. Now that the world knows about that, she says,  Now, I have no more secrets.  I would have to look over the next year or two and see,  Can I do a better job on the outside?  or  Am I in a position now that I can do a better job for my community on the inside?

 The UN Just Sent Trump A DIRE Warning About Obamacare,"It would seem that the Democrats  talking point, that healthcare is a human right, isn t just a talking point. The United Nations has taken notice of Republicans  efforts to repeal Obamacare without a solid replacement that will guarantee nobody loses their coverage. The GOP s plans all involve stipulations that could strip coverage from millions, which could violate international laws to which the U.S. is bound.The U.N. s High Commissioner on Human Rights sent a letter to the Trump administration, and asked that it be shared with Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress. Of course, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, didn t receive it, at least, not through the usual channels. Oddly enough, neither did Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell.Apparently, the State Department never saw it either, but an employee at HHS leaked it to Democratic leadership.The letter cites Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which says: [Countries have] the core obligation to ensure the right of access to health facilities, goods and services on a non-discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable or marginalized groups. It also cites Article 5(e) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which says: [Countries should] guarantee the right of everyone,  including  the rights to public health, medical care, social security and social services  without regard to race or color. It s important to note that while we both signed and ratified the latter agreement here.If Obamacare is repealed without a replacement that protects coverage for everyone, the people who stand to lose their insurance, and thus, their access to healthcare, are the poor and the working class. Racial minorities are more likely to be poor, or a member of the struggling working class. Rural areas with depressed economies (the places that all voted for Trump) would suffer, too.Since the Trump administration didn t send the letter on as requested, it stands to reason that they don t want Congress to see this (or really, anyone). Too bad it got out. At best, this is another PR and political disaster that Trump doesn t need. At worst, we re in some serious trouble if they don t give up their plans to strip millions of their health insurance.Featured image by Olivier Douliery-Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2017"
 Republicans Just Granted Themselves Special Status In Their Latest Healthcare Bill,"If you have a pre-existing condition, Obamacare currently protects you from being turned down for insurance on the basis of that condition. Republicans want to take that away because insuring sick people just eats too much profit, and healthcare is a privilege, not a right anyway. The latest iteration of their ridiculous healthcare plan will allow states to decide whether insurers have to cover people with pre-existing conditions, because of course it does, but it also contains a brand-new amendment that s patently disgusting.It carves an exemption out for members of Congress and their staffs. Insurers would still be required to provide coverage for them regardless of pre-existing conditions. Vox confirmed it last night: A spokesperson for Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) who authored this amendment confirmed this was the case: members of Congress and their staff would get the guarantee of keeping these Obamacare regulations. But don t Republicans hate Obamacare? Well, their relationship with Obamacare is actually considerably more complex than we tend to give it credit for. Contrary to popular belief, we taxpayers don t subsidize Congress  health insurance the way many people think. In fact, we never did. Until 2013, they were covered under the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, which is a health insurance marketplace where they (and every other federal employee) purchase health insurance with all the same bullshit as everyone else, and have their premiums taken out of their paychecks.The Office of Personnel Management contributes to each employee s premium, but where private sector employers cover an average of 83 percent of their employees  premiums (or 72 percent for family plans), OPM covers 72 to 75 percent, whichever is less depending on a variety of factors, across the board.In 2013, all of Congress was kicked off of FEHB thanks to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA). He proposed an amendment to the ACA that would require all members of Congress to purchase health insurance through the exchanges, and for their staffs under the small business provision.So that s what they ve been doing for health insurance for the last four years. Where their own lives are concerned, Obamacare s popular provisions are good things. Where the rest of the country is concerned, though, well, we all know how they feel about the rest of us. The prohibition on denying insurance due to pre-existing conditions is one of the most popular provisions and they want to gut it.For everyone but themselves.Can they get any more obvious about where their true priorities lie?Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2017"
 Court Slams Down Trump’s Order Blocking Funding To Sanctuary Cities,"During the 2016 presidential campaign, President Donald Trump made a lot of promises on immigration. He was going to build a wall between the United States and Mexico, that Mexico would fund. He was going to keep Muslims from coming into the country. Lastly, he was going to cut funding to  sanctuary cities.  Now it looks like none of that is going to happen. The travel bans have been struck down. The border wall is never going to happen. Now, a federal court has ruled against taking funding away from sanctuary cities.Sanctuary cities are those that refuse to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to deport undocumented immigrants who report crimes. It s important to note that lacking documentation is a civil offense, not a criminal one. This is the second of Trump s main policy initiatives to be struck down because it violates the U.S. Constitution.Both San Francisco and Santa Clara County won orders squashing an executive order, signed by Trump on January 25, 2017 to halt funding to any cities who refuse to deport undocumented immigrants for minor offenses. The president has said these cities can cause,  immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our republic.  U.S. District Judge William Orrick did not see it that way. He sided with San Francisco and Santa Clara County.While Trump wants to appear powerful, it is clear that he is not aware of what limits there are on presidential power. The president does not decide how federal funds are spent. That s Congress s job. The budget that is submitted by the White House every year is simply a wish list of what the president would like to see federal money spent on. Congress is under no obligation to follow the budget. By the same token, once funds have been allocated for a program, a president cannot just block that funding because it suits his or her objectives.The White House promises to appeal the decision and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has said that the courts in California are  going bananas.  He added,  The idea that an agency can t put in some reasonable restriction on how some of these monies are spent is something that will be overturned eventually, and we ll win at the Supreme Court level at some point. For its part, the Department of Justice assets that federal agencies are still allowed to act against any cities or towns that violate or ignore federal immigration laws. Department spokesman Ian Prior said,  The court upheld the government s ability to use lawful means to enforce existing conditions of federal grants,  Ian Prior said in an emailed statement. The ruling is not just a victory for these two jurisdictions. Its impact will be felt in sanctuary cities and jurisdictions across the nation. Cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. This ruling is also giving energy to Californians who want to be seen as leading the resistance against the Trump administration. The Californian state Senate put through the  California Values Act.  This would turn the entire state into a sanctuary zone.",News,"April 26, 2017"
" Sean Spicer Baffles Reporters, Claims Trump Isn’t Responsible For Hiring Flynn (VIDEO)","On Tuesday, White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer once again baffled reporters and other thinking individuals by once again saying the dumbest thing imaginable.Asked why the White House refuses to provide documents related to former National Security Advisor and registered foreign agent Michael Flynn s hiring, Spicer took the tried-and-true route of blaming President Obama.Spicer explained that the Trump White House isn t responsible for anything related to Flynn s hiring because the documents were filled out   during the Obama administration  and  those are not documents that the White House would ever possess. Everything that the White House has been asked to do, the only documents that were made available to [Congress] that they asked for were the ones that the Department of Defense had,  Spicer said, explaining that he doesn t feel that the White House has an obligation to provide the information Congress has requested. How about these calls made where [Flynn] was working during the transition on behalf of a future President Trump?  CBS s Major Garrett asked.  Aren t those things that you should have some responsibility or obligation to provide if you can? It s a question [of] if you can,  Spicer said.  To ask for every call a national security adviser made is pretty outlandish. Those calls were made on behalf of the Trump transition were they not?  Garrett asked. Spicer, of course, told him that Trump isn t responsible for anything that happened before January 20 even if it was done by a member of the Trump transition team. When?  Spicer asked.  We started this administration on Jan. 20. All the information that they re talking about occurred prior to him being at the White House. Working for the transition!  Garrett pressed. Not at the White House!  Spicer snapped.  Everything that is being questioned occurred prior to Jan. 20th.

" Trump Just Sent A MAJOR F*ck You To The Supreme Court, CONFIRMS His Own Incompetency (DETAILS)","Donald Trump and his administration have proven time and time again that they are incapable of performing even the most simple, basic tasks that only require basic human decency and manners. The latest gaffe in the White House demonstrates that even as Trump s 100th day approaches, they still can t get their sh*t together.According to a White House aide and court spokeswoman, Trump did not extend a formal invitation to the Supreme Court to have dinner at the White House on Thursday. An initial report that was released early Sunday stated that a dinner WOULD take place: That evening, the President will have dinner with the Justices of the Supreme Court, including his successfully confirmed nominee Justice Neil Gorsuch. However, this changed just hours later. On Sunday night, the dinner with the Supreme Court justices was taken off the agenda. The White House aide confirmed: An invitation was never extended. When White House press secretary Sean Spicer was questioned about the nixed dinner plans, Spicer said Trump s staffers  moved some things around  and perhaps the dinner might happen at a later time. Spicer said: I think having a relationship and meeting with the Supreme Court at some point would be a great idea and something that we hope to have on the schedule at some point soon. Trump s rude, disorganized cancellation is hardly the only issue with these tentative dinner plans. While former presidents have had dinner with Supreme Court justices before, Trump s corrupt administration definitely raised some eyebrows when they first announced these dinner plans. Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said it best: Why would the Supreme Court agree to do this? I can think of no legitimate reason to dine with a litigant. No matter what Trump does, he can t help but raise ethical concerns as his scandals and conflict of interests only mount up. Trump s administration is not only the most incompetent, lazy, and disorganized, but it is the most corrupt and must be watched closely.Featured image via Tom Pennington / Getty Images",News,"April 25, 2017"
 New Poll Has Very Bad News For The NRA (DETAILS),"While it may not come as much of a surprise that the leadership at the National Rifle Association (NRA) has a different opinion on gun control than the average American, what is surprising is that same leadership holds a different opinion than the American gun owner. According to a new poll, at least 67 percent of gun owners in the United States believe that the organization has changed its mission from one promoting gun safety to one dominated by professional lobbyists. They say the NRA has been  overtaken by lobbyists and the interests of gun manufacturers and lost its original purpose and mission. The NRA of today looks very different from what it looked like before. In fact, for most of its history, it supported, and even wrote, gun control legislation. Adam Winkler, author of Gunfight: the Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America, wrote,  Historically, the leadership of the NRA was more open-minded about gun control than someone familiar with the modern NRA might imagine. To understand the relationship the NRA has with gun control. It may help to look at who and why it was founded. After the Civil War, many people in the North believed that people in the South possessed superior skills in the area of using rifles. They blamed that for the length of the war. The national slogan for the NRA was,  Firearms Safety Education, Marksmanship Training, Shooting for Recreation.  Its main goal was to improve men s marksmanship, not ward off threats to the Second Amendment. The organization was founded in 1871.That effort didn t start until the 1970s. In 1934, the nation saw its first piece of gun control legislation signed into law. The National Firearms Act of 1934 was designed to  make it difficult for any not law abiding citizen to obtain a pistol or revolver.  It was authored, in part, by the NRA. They also helped write the Gun Control Act of 1938.When these bills were written and signed into law, Karl T. Frederick was president of the NRA. He said,  I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons. I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses. For about a century, the NRA s motto remained the same. Then the 1960s happened. With the unrest of the assassinations and the rise of the Black Panthers, The Mulford Act was passed in California. It barred people from carrying loaded weapons around outside. While it was supported by the NRA, the backlash that it spurred also galvanized a new wave of gun support. About a decade after the act was signed into law, a group of gun rights supporters took over the NRA. They ousted the leadership and changed the motto to,  The Right Of The People To Keep And Bear Arms Shall Not Be Infringed. Since then, the NRA has opposed many measures that have had widespread support from the American public. In poll after poll, people say they want people who buy guns to pass background checks, they want to limit the capacity of rifles and they support common sense gun control legislation. Even Supreme Court Justice Anontin Scalia supported limiting some of this. In his Heller v. DC decision, Scalia wrote,  Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. New data show more support for gun control from gun owners. While the NRA leadership says one thing, the average gun owner thinks another. A few years ago, Wayne LaPierre, NRA chief, said,  The only thing that can stop a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun.  This is the response from gun owners to that new poll.For its part, the NRA is disputing the accuracy of the poll. Jennifer Baker, spokesperson for the NRA said,  The NRA s strength is derived from our five million members and the tens of millions of Second Amendment supporters who vote. The majority of Americans oppose gun control and they made their voices heard this past November. This was a poll paid for by a gun control group, so it s not surprising that the so called  results  further their agenda. Public Policy Polling conducted the poll between April 19 and 20. It included 661 people who own guns. The margin of error is four percentage points. Americans for Responsible Solutions commissioned the poll.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 25, 2017"
 BREAKING: Mexico Stands Strong AGAINST Trump’s Wall; Delivers BRUTAL Remarks,"It s not just Canada that Donald Trump seems to be starting unnecessary battles with today, Mexico has responded to his continued persistence of the border wall.In fact, Mexico is now considering Trump s insistence of the wall, and the lie that Mexico will pay for it, a  hostile  act.According to Reuters Politics: JUST IN: Mexican foreign minister says Mexico considers construction of border wall a  hostile  act, will not contribute in any way JUST IN: Mexican foreign minister says Mexico considers construction of border wall a 'hostile' act, will not contribute in any way  Reuters Politics (@ReutersPolitics) April 25, 2017This comes shortly after Trump recommitted his efforts to build the wall.According to the New York Times: President Trump insisted on Tuesday that he remained committed to his hotly disputed plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, despite backing off a demand that the project be funded in a short-term spending measure that must be passed by Friday to avoid a government shutdown.

 Trump SLAMS Canada By Using Example Border State; That State Doesn’t Border Canada (TWEET),"It can easily be said that Donald Trump doesn t have a clue what he is doing. He hears things in clips and talking points, and then spews them out to the world, usually via Twitter, without thinking about the weight of his actions.One of the things Trump has been hung up on lately is Canada taking control of their dairy. According to Business Insider: Last year, Canada implemented a policy that created a new class of milk prices for ultra-filtered milk, a liquid, high-protein concentrate sometimes used to make products such as cheese and yogurt. Canada lowered the prices for this milk class, so as to incentivize domestic ultra-filtered milk and better compete with the US-produced imports. How dare they, right? The United States should not only legislate in their own country regarding the market but also around the world. At least that s what Trump seems to think.So Trump, trying to puff his chest and seem like he s a tough guy, tweets out: Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch! Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch!  Donald J.

 Cummings And Chaffetz Reveal ‘MAJOR PROBLEM’ For Trump: Appears Flynn Committed A Felony (VIDEO),"Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD) dropped a bombshell on Tuesday morning. During a press conference, they announced what Cummings described as a  major problem  for the Trump administration: it looks like former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn committed a felony. We received a response from the White House refusing to provide any of the documents we requested,  Cummings said.  The White House has refused to offer a single piece of paper in response to this committee s bipartisan request. According to the congressman, classified military documents have revealed that Flynn failed to disclose payments he received from foreign governments before he became Trump s National security advisor. This is a major problem,  Cummings said. I believe these documents should be declassified to the fullest extent possible without compromising sources or methods,  he added.Cumings also noted that Flynn s illegal actions could land him in prison for up to five years. Chaffetz said that if these documents are correct, then Flynn s actions were clearly illegal   and there will be consequences. As a former military officer, you simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else,  Chaffetz said.  And it appears as if he did take that money, it was inappropriate, and there are repercussions for it as a violation of the law. The congressmen, who both serve as senior members of the House Oversight Committee, said that so far, they haven t seen a shred of evidence to suggest that Flynn actually followed the law and got permission from the federal government before taking cash from multiple foreign governments.You can watch video of their press conference, here:Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 25, 2017"
 WATCH: Jake Tapper HUMILIATES Trump With The Sad Truth About His Pathetic First 100 Days,"Donald Trump recently said that grading his first 100 days is a ridiculous standard, but as Jake Tapper points out, Trump set the standard himself during the campaign.When Mitt Romney ran for president in 2012, he quickly made a name for himself as a serial flip-flopper. Well, Donald Trump is flip-flopping even more.Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump made a lot of promises about what he would get done during his first 100 days, even going so far as to present a 100 days action plan listing what Americans could expect him to accomplish during that period.But now that his first 100 days winding down, Trump realized that he is a total failure and quickly posted a tweet designed to make it sound like the first 100 days standard is no big deal.No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2017Trump has even released a list of his so-called  historic accomplishments  to make it appear like he has done great things since taking over the White House.Jake Tapper was not impressed and it only took him four minutes to take Trump down on Monday night.The CNN host began informing Trump of his record low approval ratings and pointed out that not a single major piece of legislation has been signed despite Republicans controlling Congress. With historically low approval ratings and zero pieces of major legislation signed into law, President Trump has had an empirically disappointing first 100 days. Perhaps that s the reason he recently tweeted about the  ridiculous  standard of the first 100 days. Indeed, Trump often brags about himself and whines about the media when they tell the truth about him.Tapper then demonstrated Trump s hypocrisy by showing clips of him repeatedly bragging about how much he would get done in the first 100 days. In other words, Trump held himself to the standard that he now claims is  ridiculous. He changed his tune on this marker this very conceit that he promoted with his 100-day action plan,  Tapper continued.  Which is not really a surprise, because President Trump often heralds his flexibility. Tapper went on to hit Trump for flip-flopping on all of his positions during the campaign, like when he said that  NATO is obsolete,  only to turn around and admit that NATO is not obsolete after coming face to face with NATO officials. Then there was the time Trump dismissed the unemployment rate as  phony,  which was under 5 percent during the campaign, only to brag about the same numbers when the first jobs reports came out under his presidency.Then there s healthcare, which Trump bragged would be easy to deal with during the campaign. He promised Americans would get cheap healthcare. Now, he admits it s  complicated  after failing to repeal the popular Affordable Care Act.Trump also failed to cripple a Syrian air base he ordered bombed. Botched a raid in Yemen that left a soldier, an American girl, and many civilians dead. His two immigration bans have been blocked by the courts, and a government shutdown looms because Trump refuses to budge on funding his useless border wall.In the end, Tapper also hit Trump for complaining about executive orders during the campaign, only to sign 25 within his first 100 days, more than any president since World War II. In fact, Trump is on pace to sign more executive orders than President Obama. Trump is also on pace to take more vacations days, spend more taxpayer dollars on those vacation days, and play more rounds of golf.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is a loser. That s the one word that best sums up Trump and his disastrously embarrassing first three months in office.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 25, 2017"
" For Bannon, The Losses Just Keep Coming","Steve Bannon is portrayed as the Grim Reaper on Saturday Night Live. There is a  President Steve Bannon  meme out there from coverage of the controversial advisor. In reality, his influence seems to be headed nowhere but down. First, he totally blew President Donald Trump s health care initiative. Then, his influence waned further when he openly seemed to fight with son-in-law Jared Kushner and urged the president to not take action in Syria. Now, Trump has even backpedaled on this demands that Congress fund the wall between the United States and Mexico, against the wishes of Steve Bannon.The border wall with Mexico was a big part of the Trump campaign. All of his rallies included a session of chanting with the audience of  Build the Wall!  For his part, Trump never acknowledged that Mexico is never going to pay for this expensive wall. It is also part of Bannon s dreams for the United States. His worldview, which was front and center during the president s Inaugural Address, needs this wall.Bannon is so enamored by the wall that he was pushing for a government shutdown to get Congress to include funding for it. Clearly, he learned nothing from the healthcare debacle where he told Trump to try to strong arm Congress into passing their bill because Trump wanted them to. Bannon s lack of experience dealing with our legislative branch is clear. As a co-equal branch of government, its members are never going to do something just because the White House tells them to. If you are thinking Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) pushed through Neil Goresuch s nomination because of this kind of work, you miss the win it gave McConnell.This week, Bannon told his supporters,  This is a stand worth taking. We re drawing a line in the sand. It looks more and more like Bannon is going to be alone drawing that line as if you didn t think his days in the West Wing were numbered before, it is more than clear that they are now.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,"April 25, 2017"

Wow. Putting a halt to hiring federal workers is so difficult, is it not?He s also trumpeting his job creation  successes,  which include greenlighting both the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and his  buy American, hire American  initiative. Neither of these orders is really going to accomplish anything. Nor will his  buy American steel  initiative considering that the pipelines have long since purchased their steel, and most of it isn t American.He s touting the wall as an accomplishment too, even though Congress isn t likely to fund it, and he s listing his Muslim ban, which has been halted in federal court and has likewise done nothing.Indeed, all he can really claim as an accomplishment at all is getting Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court. Carter had a tumultuous first 100 days, too, but at least he managed to get an economic stimulus package through Congress. Trump hasn t gotten any major legislation through at all.Featured image by Molly Riley-Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 25, 2017"
" NC GOP Judge Leaves Bench In DISGUST, Gives Corrupt GOP Legislature A MASSIVE F-You (DETAILS)","North Carolina GOP Judge J. Douglas McCullough has had enough of doing the bidding of a corrupt, GOP-controlled legislature who is attempting to do all it can to make sure that newly-elected Democratic Governor Roy Cooper has no power. So, what did Judge McCulloough do? He resigned. In his seat will be Democratic Judge John Arrowood. Judge McCullough has been on the bench since President Ronald Reagan put him there, but clearly his abrupt decision to leave means that he is one of the few Republicans who still puts country ahead of party.Ever since Governor Cooper took over from the nightmare that was Republican Governor Pat McCrory, the GOP-controlled legislature has been steadily doing all it can to make sure that Gov. Cooper is nothing more than a figurehead. One way in which they were doing that was to try to keep Gov. Cooper from appointing judges, as is his right as governor.In order to circumvent this, the state legislature introduced a bill that would change the number of judges on the North Carolina Court of Appeals from 15 to 12. The bill, House Bill 239, would make sure that Cooper would not get to appoint the replacements for the judges that are approaching the age at which judges in North Carolina are required to retire. Of course, Gov. Cooper vetoed the ridiculous bill, but the Republicans have a veto-proof majority, so they would have just overridden it.Judge McCullough was aware that he would be at the aforementioned required retirement age in just 36 days, so instead of stepping down and going through the formal nomination process on that date, he made sure that Gov. Cooper got his rightful appointment. As an extra thumb at the Republicans, Judge Arrowood also happens to be openly gay   the first openly gay judge on the Court of Appeals.In his very short resignation letter, Judge McCullough explained his actions: I did not want my legacy to be the elimination of a seat and the impairment of a court that I have served on. Thank you, Judge McCullough, for doing the right thing here. Republicans in this nation care only about power and partisanship, not about country. Thank you for being one of the good guys. Maybe a few others will follow in your footsteps and put country first as well.Featured image via The Advocate (Cooper)/Loiacono Literary Agency (McCullough)",News,"April 25, 2017"
 Trump Supporter Scott Baio Makes SHOCKINGLY Insensitive Comment About Former Co-Star’s Death,"On Saturday, the internet was shocked to learn of the apparent sudden death of former Happy Days and Joanie Loves Chachi star, Erin Moran, who was only 56. The internet being the internet, people waited with bated breath to hear what the co-star and ex-boyfriend formerly known as Chachi and currently known as a right-wing nut job had to say about Moran. Scott Baio s response was exactly as assholish as you d expect it to be if you ve followed what he calls a career in recent years.His comment started out respectfully enough.My sincere condolences. #ErinMoran #HappyDaysFamily pic.twitter.com/5b0AbioZEc  Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) April 23, 2017Then things took a horrible turn when he was interviewed on The Bernie and Sid show on WABC. My thing is, I feel bad because her whole life, she was troubled, could never find what made her happy and content. For me, you do drugs or drink, you re gonna die,  he continued. I m sorry if that s cold, but God gave you a brain, gave you the will to live and thrive and you gotta take care of yourself,  Baio told the radio hosts.  I m saddened by what happened. I don t know if it was drugs that killed her, I read one report said it might have been and I hope it   I don t know what I hope. It s what it is. What can you do? She was just an insecure human being and fell into this world of drugs and alcohol. Again, I don t know if that s what killed her, I m sure it was a culmination of years and years of doing it that might have had something to do with it. She just never found her way,  he said, revealing that he had tried to get her help many years ago. How do you help somebody that doesn t want to help themselves?  he asked rhetorically.  You try a couple of times and if they don t want the help, I gotta go, sorry. Baio was right about one thing. He didn t know how Moran died. She had stage four cancer.Now, Baio is on the defensive, blaming the backlash on the fact that he supported Donald Trump (his Twitter photo is with Trump).I said  IF . @ChaseMit . My wife @MrsScottBaio spoke to Erin less than 1 month ago. You bash me ONLY because I support Pres @realDonaldTrump  Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) April 24, 2017Then, like his orange idol, Baio blamed the media for at first reporting on Moran s drug use.The media did first speculate that it was drug use, but that wasn t what was offensive about Baio s interview. What was offensive was his harsh judgment of, regardless of how she died, a sick woman. Baio, like most Republicans these days, believes that he is holier than thou and like Trump, when called out on it, lashes out and blames the  fake media. As for Moran, we can only hope she finds the peace she deserves and we wish her loved ones the best.Featured image via Getty/Alex Wong",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Republicans Just RUINED Trump’s Plan To Bully The Government Into Funding Border Wall (DETAILS),"Donald Trump has just been screwed over by members of his own party, thanks to his insistence on a border wall that is absolutely pointless and won t actually work.At Congress has been at a standstill over including Trump s border wall in government spending, Republican lawmakers are now agreeing with Democrats by supporting a  clean  spending bill so the government won t have to stop working on Friday. This push takes Trump s border wall out of the running for funding.Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) said: Ideological litmus tests on a spending bill like this simply create partisan roadblocks. With so many pressing issues facing our country, we need to work together to keep the lights on and avoid another expensive shutdown that weakens not only our economy but our national security. Mick Mulvaney, who is Trump s budget director, tried to make a deal with Congress by promising that Obamacare would get more funding if Trump s wall was funded. Clearly okay with manipulating Americans into funding a wall that no one wants, Mulvaney said: We d offer them $1 of CSR [Obamacare] payments for $1 of wall payments. Right now that s the offer that we ve given to our Democratic colleagues. No one in the Democratic party actually wants this border wall to be funded   and Chuck Schumer pointed out exactly why. These are points that even Republicans can t argue with:A spokesman for Schumer blasted the Trump administration for trying to use Obamacare to bribe lawmakers into funding Trump s wall: The White House gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans, in order to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the President said would be paid for by Mexico is a complete non-starter.The US government is supposed to take care of its citizens and, according to the President, Mexico is supposed to pay for the wall. If the administration would drop their 11th hour demand for a wall that Democrats, and a good number of Republicans oppose, Congressional leaders could quickly reach a deal. Trump needs to just admit that the border wall he promised his brainless supporters was a flawed idea, and it is only going to cost America in the end.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Republicans Are Secretly TERRIFIED That Trump Is Already Handing Congress To The Democrats,"How bad is Trump for the GOP? It seems he s worse than many would have guessed. As his 100th day in office approaches, more people are noticing that he s gotten nothing done. And the party is starting to realize just how much of a problem this could be. Lawmakers who are up for election every two years pretty much never stop campaigning, and the parties are always working on the next election.But the Republican Party is having trouble finding candidates who will commit to running for 2018. According to Politico: Potential GOP candidates whom party leaders want to recruit are afraid of walking into a buzz saw, uncertain about what kind of political environment they ll be facing by the time the midterms come around   and what Trump s record will look like But interviews with more than a dozen top Republican operatives, donors and officials reveal a growing trepidation about how the initial days of the new political season are unfolding. And they underscore a deep anxiety about how the party will position itself in 2018 as it grapples with the leadership of an unpredictable president still acclimating to Washington. Trump and his mouthpieces keep assuring the press that things are humming along and that he s already accomplished a great deal. If they re talking about all the executive orders, then Zac Petkanas has some harsh words for them. According to him, all those EOs are just theater   a way to look like he s doing something:.@Zac_Petkanas on @POTUS  first 100 days:  Most of these executive orders, they re theater It is the perception of activity.  #first100 pic.twitter.com/XwFUxFLrYC  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 24, 2017They re also worried about vacant House seats in deep red states. Jon Ossof, in Georgia, very narrowly lost his special election outright and will proceed to a runoff in June against Republican candidate Karen Handel. In Kansas, the Democratic candidate made it a much closer race than it otherwise should have been.Democrats who don t really vote all that much have been turning out for these elections at a far higher rate than Republicans who don t vote too much. Furthermore, not only is Trump s approval rating at a record low for this point in his administration, but Congress  own approval rating   particularly that of Republicans   has fallen sharply since February, too. A big part of that is their failure to pass their healthcare bill along with the looming shutdown threat.In other words, 2018 is starting to look like a referendum on Trump and his sheer incompetence. And that has Republicans running scared.Good.Featured image by Aude Guerrucci-Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Donald Trump Just Used The World Trade Center Collapsing To Brag About Himself (FULL QUOTE),"It s become more than obvious that Donald Trump has absolutely no filter when he speaks. He says exactly what is on his mind, and as it would appear, he may even believe his own lies.What Trump also seems to believe, is that he s the best thing that ever happened to the world and we should all be grateful to be alive during his existence on the planet. He s obsessed with how much people either like him or don t like him, and what he s most obsessed with is ratings. He seems to live for ratings and how many people saw him at any particular time. It s very pathetic that he seems to need this gratification.However, in a recent unfiltered moment from Trump, he compared himself to 9/11/01 and the ratings  Face the Nation  got covering the World Trade Center collapsing.In an interview with The Associated Press, as they spoke with Trump, they said: And that s one of the difficulties I think presidents have had is that you can have these personal relationships with people from the other party, but then it s hard to actually change how people vote or change how people  This is when Trump decided to say: No I have, it s interesting, I have, seem to get very high ratings. I definitely. You know Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people, it s the highest in the history of the show. I have all the ratings for all those morning shows. When I go, they go double, triple. Chris Wallace, look back during the Army-Navy football game, I did his show that morning. Um, ok  and AP responded with,  I remember, right.  However, Trump wasn t done. He continued: It had 9.2 million people. It s the highest they ve ever had. On any, on air, (CBS  Face the Nation  host John) Dickerson had 5.2 million people. It s the highest for  Face the Nation  or as I call it,  Deface the Nation.  It s the highest for  Deface the Nation  since the World Trade Center. Since the World Trade Center came down. It s a tremendous advantage. He then went off on a tangent about the  fake news  or whatever.The fact that he s comparing, and randomly so, his ratings on a show to the coverage of the World Trade Center collapsing isn t only bizarre, it s depraved. He s literally trying to say that he s so popular, he can beat the ratings of the worst domestic disaster on American soil. Not only that, he says this after making a terrible joke.What the f**k is wrong with him? This is about as shameful as one could EVER possibly get.Featured photo via Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
 DISGUSTING GOP Plan Would Make People Prove They Are Worthy Of Healthcare,"Poverty is a moral failure, don t you know? Being born rich is the only thing that washes away all sins (or is it that rich people are born without sin?), at least that s the attitude of modern Republicans. Kentucky s governor, though, has a solution for that. Like a child earning an allowance, Governor Matt Bevin devised a chart where people can earn points with good behavior and those points would help them cover health care costs.The plan, which sounds more like a virtual punch card you might use at a Marriott, rather than one for attaining healthcare, is called  MyRewards Account.  MyRewards Account is a list of hoops that poor people have to jump through before they earn enough points to get dental or eye exams. Bevin is selling it as an expansion of benefits, when in reality, it s a humiliating way to make the most basic human right of healthcare as a carrot with a huge stick attached to it.The biggest change is Bevin s proposal to charge premiums for Medicaid and impose an annual $1,000 deductible before the program covers beneficiaries  health care costs. Those are big price hikes for people who can t afford them. Similar policies have driven down insurance rates and harmed public health outcomes in other states already.Source: Think ProgressThe plan would give petty sums of money to be used toward healthcare benefits that Kentuckyians currently enjoy for doing things like try to find a job, when in fact, most Medicaid recipients do have jobs. It also rewards people for not smoking or for having  no inappropriate ER visits.  You d better hope that isn t really indigestion before claiming you might be having a heart attack.CREDIT: Kentucky HEALTH Program Requirements SpecificationObviously, this intrusive and completely unjust plan has more than a few critics, including anyone who cares at all about personal liberties (isn t that what these Ayn Rand humpers are all about?) This requires building a massive database about people s individual behaviors, and then keeping it up. Never mind that it s massively expensive, it also feels very invasive,  former Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator Andy Slavitt said in an interview.  I m not sure the government should be tracking if I put on five pounds, or if I m advancing in my job, or what grade I got on my GED exam. The party that doesn t seem concerned at all that their president hasn t even provided his tax returns see no hypocrisy in their insistence that the poor live under a microscope. The poor are not children who need constant suprevision, they are adults are deserve to be treated as such. Remember, Christians, Jesus was poor.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Trump Runs Full Page Ad For Mar-a-Lago Across Several Government Websites,"Visitors to several government websites may notice that there is an article popping up highlighting Mar-a-Lago   which is odd because Mar-a-Lago isn t government property, its a private resort owned and managed by Donald Trump himself. Burrowing into the article, a reader may notice that the piece isn t written in a dry, serious tone befitting a governmental agency, its one glorified advertisement for the place Trump and his family exclusively profit from which places a positive spin on Trump s Mar-a-Lago profiteering.Right from the start, the marketing angle is obvious. It, like Trump, insists on calling Mar-a-Lago the  Winter White House  a term made up by Trump to justify his numerous vacations to Florida. Nobody agreed to label Mar-a-Lago the  winter White House  and given its lack of security and the way it profits from Trump s access, calling it a White House is in all likelihood illegal. Nevertheless, Trump and writer Leigh Hartman insist.Mar-a-Lago, President Trump s Florida estate, has become well known as the president frequently travels there to work or host foreign leaders.The first meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping of China will take place April 6 7 at Mar-a-Lago, which is located at the heart of Florida s Palm Beach community.From his base at Mar-a-Lago, Trump has golfed over a dozen times at a golf course he owns in Florida. He does not, by any account, do much  work  while he is there. In at least one example, Trump s morning filled with  meetings  turned out to be Trump s attempt to bingewatch golf in an empty dining room with two friends.Someone just posted this on Instagram from Trump's golf club. POTUS appears to be watching Golf Channel with 2 other people. pic.twitter.com/5LpVRHR1Do  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) March 26, 2017The article only gets more absurd from there.After refurbishing the house and adding an events space, Trump opened the estate to dues-paying members of the public in 1995 as the Mar-a-Lago Club.Post s dream of a winter White House came true with Trump s election in 2016. Trump regularly works out of the house he maintains at Mar-a-Lago and uses the club to host foreign dignitaries. Dues-paying members of the public  is code for  rich people.  Those members now have untold access to Donald Trump and many have been seen dining near Trump while the president discusses sensitive, sometimes classified information. They giddily share their brushes with Trump on social media, including once photographing the military staffer in charge of carrying the  nuclear football.  On Trump s end, he does much to entertain the people who pay him. Before the annual White House egg roll, Trump threw a private Easter party for rich families at Mar-a-Lago the night before.VIPs come first pic.twitter.com/75hLNSIFk2  southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) April 16, 2017And in case readers didn t understand why they should pay to go there, here is a fluffy description of the features:When socialite and cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post built Mar-a-Lago   Spanish for  Sea to Lake    in 1927, she spared no expense. The 114-room mansion sits on 8 hectares of land, with the Atlantic Ocean on one side and an inland waterway on the other.The ornate Jazz Age house was designed with Old-World Spanish, Venetian and Portuguese influences and decorated with Post s personal collection of antiques.It s baffling to think why this advertisement for Mar-a-Lago would be allowed on any government website, but it has shown up on at least two. It seems to have originated on  Share America,  a website run by the State Department with pro-America articles written in the vein of  Upworthy.  From there it was posted inexplicably on the website for the U.S. Embassy in the United Kingdom. No other articles of this nature show up on that website. The Mar-a-Lago promo seems to be unique.It s hard to imagine this isn t blatantly illegal. Trump s private business is once again getting a major boost thanks to the government Trump now believes he controls. It s like cranking his conflict of interest violations up to 11.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Trump Threatens Government Shutdown If Congress Doesn’t Approve Billions To Fund His Border Wall,"Donald Trump and the Republicans are about to prove once and for all that they are incapable of governing.Despite having control of Congress and the White House, Republicans are on the verge of causing a government shutdown because Trump is demanding that funding for his useless border wall be included in the budget.The deadline to pass a new budget is Friday, when the temporary funding bill that was passed in December expires.Over the weekend, Trump s budget director Mick Mulvaney made it clear that Trump is obsessed with funding the massive wall and that not funding the project would be unacceptable. This suggests that Trump will veto any budget that does not include it. We ve finally boiled this negotiation down to something we want very badly that the Democrats really don t like and that s the border wall,  Mulvaney claimed.  At the same time, there s something they want very badly that we don t like very much, which are these cost-sharing reductions in the Obamacare payments. Trump followed up with a series of tweets on Sunday.ObamaCare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going   otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2017The Democrats don t want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2017Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2017Yes, Mulvaney and Trump are literally threatening to take healthcare away from Americans if Democrats and Republicans continue to refuse to waste taxpayer dollars on a wall that won t do anything to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants crossing into the country.As the Berlin Wall demonstrated, people will still find a way to cross the border if they are desperate enough, even at the risk of death.Also, the number of people crossing the border illegally is already way down and has been for some time. The number was even dropping while President Obama was in office. The drop in the number of undocumented immigrants crossing the border makes Trump s wall even more unnecessary.The wall would not only cost billions to build, it s likely that a Mexican company would be contracted to do the work and it would irreparably harm migration patterns of animals and destroy habitats.Overall, the wall is a bad idea. But Trump is desperate to achieve anything as his first 100 days come to a close. Trump made a lot of promises about what he would do in his first 100 days, and the border wall was his top promise.But the wall is an unpopular idea as well. Only 28 percent of Americans support it, and Republicans and Democrats in the Southwest agree that it shouldn t be built.If Trump and Republicans continue to insist on wasting taxpayer dollars on a wall, a government shutdown is inevitable and Democrats won t be at fault.The last two major government shutdowns were in 1995 and 2013. In both instances, a Democrat was in the White House. But Republicans controlled Congress in 1995 and controlled the House in 2013 while Democrats controlled the Senate, albeit without a 60-vote majority and the fact that Republicans obstructed everything.The point is, however, that the American people blamed Republicans for both of those shutdowns. And they will definitely blame Republicans again because Republicans control the White House and Congress this time.Republicans are literally facing a no-win scenario.Republicans in the House and Senate NEED Democrats in order to pass Trump s wall funding because 60 votes are needed in the Senate and it s likely that hardline conservatives will vote against the budget in the House.And since many Republicans also don t support the wall, it s looking like Trump will have to be the one to back down and we all know that Trump doesn t like backing down. And that means he will be the one responsible for causing a government shutdown that will hurt our country, no matter hard hard he tries to pin the blame on Democrats. Democrats do not control Congress, nor do they control the White House. This is all on Trump and Republicans.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Trump Insists He Would Still Beat Hillary In The Popular Vote Even Though He Lost By A Landslide,"Donald Trump is still delusional and Twitter users were quick to remind him of who lost the popular vote in November.It s been almost six months since the 2016 Election concluded in November, but Trump is still under the delusion that he won the popular vote and is insisting that he would still win if another election were held.In a pair of tweets on Sunday, Trump declared that the ABC News/Washington Post poll is  fake news  even though the poll showed that most Trump supporters don t regret their vote and that a slim majority approve of his foreign policy and his pressure on American companies to keep jobs here. Apparently, Trump only believes polls are fake when the numbers are against him.For instance, his approval rating is the lowest for any president since 1945 in the first 100 days.

 Trump Loses Track Of His Rant Mid-Meltdown Just As Questions Over His Mental Health Resurface,"One Twitter user it put it this way: Thanks to his love of social media, we are watching the President of the United States have a mental collapse right in front of our eyes. In real time. It may explain why psychologists have noted a steep rise in cases of anxiety since the election. The man in charge   already the least qualified in U.S. history   is plainly not well.And speculation over Trump s mental health has only gotten worse since the release of a damning Associated Press interview in which he seems incapable of stringing together even a single coherent sentence. The full transcript is depressingly bonkers, but here s a taste:TRUMP: OK. The one thing I ve learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do. I don t watch CNN anymore.AP: You just said you did.TRUMP: No. No, I, if I m passing it, what did I just say (inaudible)?AP: You just said  TRUMP: Where? Where?AP: Two minutes ago.And here s another:You have to love people. And if you love people, such a big responsibility. (unintelligible) You can take any single thing, including even taxes. I mean we re going to be doing major tax reform. Here s part of your story, it s going to be a big (unintelligible). Everybody s saying,  Oh, he s delaying.  I m not delaying anything. I ll tell you the other thing is (unintelligible). I used to get great press. I get the worst press. I get such dishonest reporting with the media. That s another thing that really has   I ve never had anything like it before. It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said,  Well the one thing good is now I ll get good press.  And it got worse. (unintelligible) So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me. I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty.The interview goes on like that   a rambling, incoherent word salad   for its entire duration. Adding to that is Trump s own Twitter behavior, which has gone from unhinged to something far more unsettling. He s at the point where his persecution complex, or his anger, or his mental health crisis has reached such an intensity that he can t even remember to finish his 140 character thoughts. This morning, Trump woke up still angry that he s the most unpopular president at his 100-day mark in America s history. He lashed out.The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)! If  Donald J.

 ‘He’s Not Doing What I Thought’: Voters Pissed Off Over Wasting Their Vote On Trump (VIDEO),"During a sit down with Trump voters, CNN got their take on the alleged president s first 100 days. With polls showing Trump as the most unpopular president in history, some of the former reality show star s most ardent supporters have stood by him but others are fed up. One Trump supporter has had it with Trump s broken promises, such as the vow to work on the opioid epidemic spreading across America. Another Trump voter, Scott McCommons, said that he was  disappointed  with Trump s first 100 days, calling it was a  disaster. He s got enough time to get on Twitter, and rant and rave, and on top of that lie on Twitter,  he said.  I voted for the man to make America great again, and I m willing to give him a chance, but he s not doing what I thought, that he made promises at rallies that I went to. I expected him to work a little harder [on health care],  he continued.  Be a little more reasonable instead of threatening people. That s unpresidential. I voted to send him to Washington strictly because I thought he would make change, nobody would push him around. He s used his power against people, I think that s wrong. gt s been a disaster, I think, in the first 100 days. If I were to vote tomorrow, I would not vote for him,  he added.Watch courtesy of CNN:As the CNN host pointed out, Trump campaigned as the ultimate deal maker. One strong supporter of Trump s blamed House Speaker Paul Ryan for that. McCommons said Trump  isn t willing to sit down at the table and negotiate. If only Trump supporters were warned that the alleged billionaire was a con man. Oh wait, they were.

One man, Art Tanderup, who has a small, 160-acre farm in the path of Keystone XL, appeared on Fox News to discuss the problem. And he proved that he knows much more about it than the talking heads who keep trumpeting how great it is.Tanderup leads a group of 90 Nebraska farmers who are suing to stop Keystone XL s construction. When host Sandra Smith asked him if this was a  not in my backyard  thing, and whether he would fight it this aggressively if it wasn t in his backyard, he replied with: Yes we would. After we learned how destructive the chemicals in the tar sands are, we have come to realize that this type of fossil fuel should not be happening, and it doesn t matter where it s at. We need to look for other sources of renewable energy. Smith also asked him what the group s goals are, and he said: Our goal is to keep this pipeline out of the eastern sand hills of Nebraska and off the Ogallala aquifer. Our premium goal would be to leave the tar sands in the ground and move more rapidly to renewable fuels. There was discussion about the quality of tar sands oil, which is terrible   tar sands oil is dirty as hell, and refining it produces a byproduct that s worse than coal when burned (and guess what? We sell that byproduct to China, who then burns it!). It also only produces poor quality fuel, and Trans Canada would be sending it through the pipeline to Texas for refining, after which it would be exported overseas. We get no benefit at all except for possibly a few new jobs at a refinery.Smith tried to make the pipeline sound safer than rail when it comes to moving oil, and it is, but Tanderup even shot down that talking point. It was like she never even heard him say that his group believes the tar sands should stay where they are, or really, anything else he said.Watch below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"April 24, 2017"
 The GOP Congress Just Moved To Let Big Banks And The Super Rich Screw You Over,"The biggest threat to the oligarchy is for the  little guy  to have a voice, any type of voice. Republicans hate when poor people, especially minorities, vote, and now they want to restrict the way we can vote with our money.The bill, which would eliminate the banking regulations made law in 2010, as a response to the near collapse of the economy, in Dodd-Frank. As if that wasn t bad enough, there s an easter egg in the bill that would for all intents and purposes, silence small investors.Under current law, any investor, as long as they own about $2,000 in stocks, has the right to attend shareholder meetings and file proposals. In other words, any investor has a voice in how a company is run. Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R) chairs the House Financial Services Committee and his bill, which would replace Dodd-Frank, would also limit the number of people who have a voice to at most 100 people. Under his bill, only shareholders who own at least one percent of the company have any voice at all.That doesn t sound huge but think about it for a moment. Exxon is worth $392 billion. To have a voice at all, you would need to own almost $4 billion in stock. That means that if you aren t happy with Exxon s drilling practices, the company will tell you to screw yourself.If you think shareholders are generally already sympathetic to the direction of any given company, you d be wrong. There are many examples throughout history of shareholders forcing companies to do the right thing.Here s just one example:Appalled by a Bloomberg Markets Magazine cover story that linked American steel company Nucor Corp. to pig iron suppliers in Brazil who used slave labor, an investment firm with a stake in Nucor called for corrective action. Their mechanism: a shareholder resolution. The proposal appeared on Nucor s 2009 proxy statement prior to a yearly shareholder meeting   and 27 percent of the company s shareholders voted in favor it.Nucor stalled at first, but within a year, the steelmaker told the stakeholding company, Domini Social Investments LLC (now Domini Impact Investments) that it had begun requiring its manufacturers to sign an agreement with a group of nongovernmental organizations, including a pledge to break ties altogether with the suppliers using forced labor.Source: IB TimesShareholders have also been quite effective at forcing companies to be more environmentally friendly.Just who are these soon to be disenfranchised shareholders? Well, they can be anyone with a 401K or a pension. In other words, they can be you or me.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
 Trump Won’t Give Sean Spicer The Boot Because ‘That Guy Gets Great Ratings’,"White House press secretary Sean Spicer is a trainwreck. After all, this is the guy who said Hitler really wasn t that bad. Everybody tunes in daily to see what ridiculous assertion will come out of his mouth this time, and apparently, that is all the job security he needs in Donald Trump s administration.According to the Washington Post, Trump has no intention of firing Spicer because he  gets great ratings,  and in Trump s White House, ratings matter far more than facts. The WaPo article explores Trump s obsession with cable news and revealed that Spicer s job is safe as long as he can keep people turning in to watch him crash and burn. I m not firing Sean Spicer,  Trump said, according to sources.  That guy gets great ratings. Everyone tunes in. The Washington Post reports that  most of the televisions in the West Wing display four channels at all times  CNN, Fox, Fox Business and MSNBC.  The article also noted that  during an intimate lunch recently with a key outside ally in a small West Wing dining room, for instance, Trump repeatedly paused the conversation to make the group watch a particularly combative Spicer briefing. Spicer has become a laughing stock. Saturday Night Live has had a blast lampooning him in recent months, with Melissa McCarthy playing the role of the press secretary. The fact that Spicer was portrayed on SNL by a woman seemed to be more upsetting to Trump than any of Spicer s numerous gaffes.The press secretary kicked off his very first press conference by claiming that Trump s inauguration really didn t have a pathetic turnout, despite pictures proving he was full of it. And things have only gone downhill from there. But as long as America keeps tuning in for Spicer s daily dumpster fires press briefings, he can rest assured that Trump is going to keep him around.

 Yale Professor Explains Exactly Why We Need To Compare Trump To Hitler,"In the late 20th Century, author and attorney Mike Godwin said that  as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Hitler approaches.  Soon, though,  Godwin s Law  was used to invalidate any mention of Hitler, which effectively worked to white-wash a significant portion of 20th century history.Who knows, that could be why we re seeing a rise in holocaust denial and the election of Donald Trump. Now, a Yale Professor is taking on that very issue, saying that our fear of making Hitler comparisons is making us historically illiterate.Yale history professor, and author of  On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century,  Timothy Snyder isn t going so far to say that Trump is like Hitler, but he is saying that there are a lot of lessons to be learned from Hitler, specifically in how democratic republics fail and that our refusal to even talk about Hitler simply feeds our intellectual laziness.So the way to start the discussion about comparisons is to point out that Americans are extremely lazy about history. I mean that s one way in which were definitely number one among major nations. And one of the ways we re lazy about history is that as soon as anyone suggests that the past might be useful, then we say  but wait it s not exactly the same and therefore I m just going to discard it.  In that way in two or three seconds we give ourselves an excuse not to think about history.Source: Business InsiderHere s the video:var playerParam = {'pcode':'BhdmY6l9g002rBhQ6aEBZiheacDu','playerBrandingId':'6e12e8b3387a44daacfb73afba25a76e','skin': {'config': '//player.ooyala.com/static/v4/stable/latest/skin-plugin/skin.json'} };OO.ready(function() {window.pp = OO.Player.create('container', 'B1MWNzYTE6PYNvENSzDs8rjZyVjOKMu8', playerParam);        });The main reason for studying history, other than the fact that it s fascinating as hell, is to learn from what our forebears got wrong as well as from what they got right. Clearly, a hell of a lot went wrong during the late part of the 19th Century and the first half of the 20th Century. There were the robber barons, there was the Great Depression and there was the rise of fascism that killed millions of people. Perhaps if we weren t so lazy about history, we wouldn t need to talk about income inequality and banks wouldn t be too big to fail. If Mike Godwin hadn t been so wildly misinterpreted, perhaps we would not have have been silenced when comparing Trump s white nationalist following to that of Hitler. Instead, neo-nazis are now an actual voting bloc and the nation s press secretary can conveniently ignore the fact that Hitler gassed six million Jews. Hey, at least Spicer is getting us to talk about history.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 23, 2017"
 Delusional Trump Hilariously Thinks Angela Merkel Likes Him (DETAILS),"We all remember the absolutely disastrous visit Donald Trump had with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He infamously made her look at him like he had lost his mind when joked about her allegedly being wiretapped by the Obama Administration while he was busy trying to defend his own false claims that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, refused to shake Merkel s hand during a photo op, and even tried to give her a bill for NATO worth billions of dollars.Trump, however, seems to have a very different memory of his visit with the German leader. While speaking of the visit with the Associated Press, Trump said: Yeah, it s funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with Merkel. As if that weren t ridiculous enough, considering that the whole world saw how that visit actually went, Trump continued, this time trying to excuse his rudeness with the handshake debacle: And I guess somebody shouted out,  Shake her hand, shake her hand,  you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time. He went on to boast: Because, um, I m at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I m at odds on immigration. Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"April 23, 2017"
 Fox News Rails Against Media Coverage of Trump’s First 100 Days – Here’s How They Covered Obama’s,"Donald Trump s media mouthpiece, Fox News, is trying to put a positive spin on his terrible first 100 days, just like Reince Priebus and Trump himself. Part of what Fox is doing seems to be taking to Twitter to loudly complain about how the rest of the media has covered his first 100 days. Needless to say, they are very unhappy that the media s coverage has been overwhelmingly negative. To them, this demonstrates a very obvious hatred of Trump:The media s 100-day war against @POTUS. pic.twitter.com/orcTyETvzt  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 23, 2017Study: 89% of broadcast news coverage of the Trump Administration has been negative. pic.twitter.com/bSV5vCoDZZ  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 23, 2017TV News pushed relentlessly negative agenda. pic.twitter.com/G09jhqdra3  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 23, 2017But this is because it s Trump. Fox News was similarly negative during Obama s first 100 days. According to George Mason University s Center for Media Affairs, Bret Baier s  Special Report  only gave positive coverage to Obama 23 percent of the time (they analyzed  Special Report  because it most closely resembles traditional broadcast news). 77 percent of their coverage was negative.Overall, only 21 percent of Fox s total coverage was positive, and that number dropped to 15 percent when discussing his policies.Perhaps more than that, though, is the fact that Fox declared their opposition to Obama as quickly as they could. In April of 2009, they were openly urging their viewers to get involved in Tea Party protests against President Obama s fiscal policy.Furthermore, they weren t afraid to use words like socialism, fascism, Marxism and even communism. They uttered those words 1,400 times during Obama s first 100 days, or 14 times per day.So really, where do they get off whining about how the media s covering Trump? The fact of the matter is that Trump has actually been a complete disaster since he got elected. His proposals are literally impossible, he thought he could strongarm both Congress and hostile world leaders into falling in line behind him, and he s spent more time golfing in his first 100 days than Obama spent in his entire first year. Calling all this out is part of the media s job.Photo of Donald Trump by Mark Wilson/Getty Images. Photo of President Obama by Kevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 23, 2017"
 WATCH: Republican Heartlessly Tells A Mother That If Her Son Wants Healthcare He Should Get A Better Job,"Wow. The cruelty of Republicans knows no bounds.Apparently, Republicans truly believe that healthcare is a privilege that only people with money should be able to receive.That s basically what Ohio GOP Rep. Warren Davidson told a mother who expressed her concern that her son won t have healthcare coverage if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act.The woman s son works in the service industry, which usually does not provide health insurance to workers. Pay is also low enough that workers qualify for Medicaid, a program that Republicans fiercely oppose because it benefits low-income Americans.Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, her son did not have health insurance. He, like millions of other Americans, could not afford it. But the Medicaid expansion finally gave him the healthcare coverage he desperately needed. Now that is being threatened by Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. Can you explain why my son and millions of others in his situation are not deserving of affordable, decent health care that has essential benefits so that he can stay healthy and continue working?  the mother asked Davidson at a town hall event on Tuesday.Davidson responded by giving a heartless answer that resulted in a round of boos and jeers from the crowd in attendance. OK, I don t know anything about your son, but as you described him, his skills are focused in an industry that doesn t have the kind of options that you want him to have for health care. So, I don t believe that these taxpayers here are entitled to give that to him. I believe he s got the opportunity to go earn those health benefits. First of all, service industry workers pay taxes, too. So they have every right to be covered by Medicaid. Second, healthcare is a right that everyone should have regardless of where they work or what industry they work in. Third, there are not enough of the kind of jobs Davidson is talking about to provide everyone in this country with workplace-provided healthcare coverage benefits. And finally, if Davidson and his Republican colleagues got off their asses and passed a law requiring the multi-billion dollar service industry to provide healthcare to their workers or pay their workers enough so they can afford to buy good health insurance plans themselves, this woman s son and millions of others would not have to live in fear of losing their coverage.But Davidson literally told this woman to tell her son to get a different job. And he dug the hole deeper for himself by compare health insurance to cell phones. If he doesn t want a catastrophic care plan, don t buy a catastrophic care plan. If you don t want a flip-phone, don t buy a flip-phone,  Davidson said. Once again, the crowd reacted in total disgust.Buying a cell phone is NOT the same as buying health insurance, and it s time for Republicans to that through their thick skulls.Health insurance costs hundreds of dollars a month or more while a cell phone payment plan is relatively cheap.In response to Davidson s remark, the woman snapped back and then walked away with the knowledge that her own congressman doesn t give a damn about her or her family. I m sorry, health care is much different than a cell phone and I m tired of people using cell phone analogies with health care,  she said.Here s the video via YouTube.

 Lying Liar Reince Priebus Says Trump Is Fulfilling Pledges At ‘Breakneck Speed’ (VIDEO),"Even though amateur president Donald Trump will likely reach the 100-day mark of his alleged presidency with no notable legislation while his contract  with the American voter  still sits on his website, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said on Sunday on NBC s  Meet the Press  that the former reality show star is fulfilling his campaign promises at  breakneck speed. And then, as if he had never met members of his own party before, Priebus blamed  historical unbelievable obstruction  from Democratic senators for the hundreds of jobs throughout the federal government the Trump s administration has failed to fill, according to Talking Points Memo:Republicans aren t called the  party of no  for no reason.In late January of 2009 after former President Barack Obama took office, this happened:The Republicans were pumped because they saw a path out of the political wilderness. They were convinced that even if Obama kept winning policy battles, they could win the broader messaging war simply by remaining unified and fighting him on everything. Their conference chairman, a then-obscure Indiana conservative named Mike Pence, underscored the point with a clip from Patton, showing the general rallying his troops for war against their Nazi enemy:  We re going to kick the hell out of him all the time! We re going to go through him like crap through a goose! From day one, Congressional Republicans made opposing Obama a political strategy. And now, one of those Republicans, Mike Pence, is vice-president.Here is Trump s  breakneck  speed at breaking promises:The Muslim ban was not implemented. Hillary Clinton will not be locked up. As a candidate, Trump repeatedly promised that he would declare China a currency manipulator immediately after he took office and now he says,  They re not currency manipulators.  Trump said he will build a wall on the US-Mexico border, and Mexico will pay for it. Mexico is not paying for it. The taxpayers are. Trump s campaign website stated, (It has since been deleted but the Internet is forever)  On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.  Trump promised to Drain the Swamp, but instead filled it up with Goldman Sachs alumni. Trump said he would give the military s top generals 30 days to submit a plan for defeating ISIS and that hasn t happened.And that s just the short list. To be sure, we re glad those promises, aside from that swamp issue, are unfulfilled. But facts matter and Reince is lying.Image via screen capture. ",News,"April 23, 2017"
" Once Again, Trump Proves How INCREDIBLY Ignorant He Is About The World (DETAILS)","President Donald Trump does not know anything about foreign policy. Now, it appears, he knows just as little about trade. This is more troubling as one of his selling points was that he was a successful businessman with a global company. You d think that a person with such a vast empire (there are Trump Towers all over the planet) would know a thing or two about the subject. This idea was blown out of the water this week by comments from a German official about Chancellor Angela Merkel s recent visit to Washington, DC.The official told The Times of London, Ten times Trump asked [German chancellor Angela Merkel] if he could negotiate a trade deal with Germany. Every time she replied,  You can t do a trade deal with Germany, only the EU.  On the eleventh refusal, Trump finally got the message,  Oh, we ll do a deal with Europe then.' For a man who claimed to be able to  make the best deals  for the United States with our trading partners, it helps to know who exactly those partners are.As bad as that is, Trump s lack of world knowledge is more than just problematic when it comes to problems the country is dealing with on the other side of the world. Not only has the Trump Administration failed to even nominate an ambassador to South Korea, up until China President Xi Jinping visited him at Mar-a-Lago, he was under the impression that the only thing that had to happen to contain North Korean leader, Kim Jung Un, was have China tell him to behave.North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2017After his visit with Xi, Trump told the Wall Street Journal,  After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it s not so easy. I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power [over] North Korea.   But it s not what you would think. Keep in mind, Trump spent a lot of time during the campaign (and before) touting,  I know China.  He claimed that the combination of the work he has done with the Chinese and the  hundreds of books  he had read about China made him an expert on the region. All of this is odd, given his comments about that short (ten minutes!) conversation. His lack of understanding goes further.After his meeting with Xi, Trump told an interviewer,  Korea actually used to be a part of China. This did not go over well with the South Korean government. South Korean foreign spokesman Cho June-hyuck responded with,  It s a clear fact acknowledged by the international community that, for thousands of years in history, Korea has never been part of China. But wait, there s more.An interview with Fox & Friends makes it appear that Trump really doesn t even know who is running North Korea right now. He told them:I hope things work out well. I hope there s going to be peace, but you know, they ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time. You read Clinton s book, he said,  Oh we made such a great peace deal,  and it was a joke. You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody s been outplayed, they ve all been outplayed by this gentleman and we ll see what happens. But I just don t telegraph my moves.Bill Clinton never dealt with the current leader, he dealt with his father, Kim Jung Il. Getting these facts wrong says a lot. Trump doesn t know who to deal with when it comes to trade with Germany. He seems to have taken his information about Chinese and Korean history from Xi. He doesn t appear to have a clue as to who the leader of North Korean leader. The questions with this president are not  What did he know and when did he know it?  but  Does he know anything and can he be taught?

 Sean Hannity Loses His Sh*t After Getting His Ass Handed To Him By New York Times Writers,"It s time for Sean Hannity to join Bill O Reilly in the unemployment line.On Saturday, the New York Times published an article reporting that Donald Trump gets policy advise from Sean Hannity among many others outside the White House. Sean Hannity tells the president that keeping promises on core Republican issues is crucial Presidents always deploy surrogates to appear on television to spout their talking points, but Mr. Trump has expanded on that by developing relationships with sympathetic media figures like Mr. Hannity who also serve as advisers. Mr. Hannity, the Fox News host, defends Mr. Trump s most controversial behavior in public, but privately, according to people close to Mr. Trump, he urges the president not to get distracted, and advises him to focus on keeping pledges like repealing the Affordable Care Act. Indeed, Hannity served as Trump s chief propagandist during the 2016 campaign and often did interviews with Hannity in order to get the kid gloves treatment.Of course, Hannity had a complete meltdown on Twitter over the article and proceeded to accuse the New York Times of  colluding  with Hillary Clinton and referred to them as  fake news,  which is something Trump would do.@nytimes You colluded with HRC in 2016.

 Trump State Campaign Chair In Hot Water For Trafficking A Kid For Sex (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is himself, a pervert. We all knew that. Despite the fact that we have audio proof of this, the  family values  party embraced him with open arms. However, the longer Trump stays in office, the more dirt that comes out about him and those associated with him. Case in point   the Kentucky state chair for Trump s 2016 presidential campaign.Tim Nolan is a member of the Board of Education of Campbell County in California, Kentucky. He is also a former judge, and he happened to run Donald Trump s state campaign there. On Friday, he was led away in handcuffs on a most disturbing charge: that he trafficked a child for sex. The local press, River City News, says that the indictment against Nolan accuses him of making a minor a victim of  commercial sexual activity.  This isn t any old scandal that just got dug up, either   Nolan allegedly was engaging in these activities while he was running Trump s campaign in the state of Kentucky in August of last year. Nolan has also been referred to by local reporters as an  outspoken and controversial  type who is constantly riding for the local Tea Party.In addition to being a child sex trafficker, Nolan is also an avowed racist who was removed from the Kentucky Boxing and Wrestling Commission after a Ku Klux Klan photo appeared on his Facebook page. Of course, since the Trump campaign was just fine with white supremacists, Klansmen and the like, they never bothered to do anything about Nolan s association with their election efforts.Nolan s supposed misdeeds were looked into with great interest by the Campbell County Police, which resulted in this indictment. Another interesting twist is that while the crimes and indictment occurred in Campbell County, the arraignment did not happen there. Why, you might ask? Well, because it would be a conflict of interest to have him appear in a courtroom where his daughter, Taunya Nolan, is a County Court Clerk.These scandals with people surrounding Trump just keep getting sicker and sicker. After all, there was just another Trump state campaign chair, Ralph Shortey of Oklahoma, who was caught in a seedy motel room smoking weed and preparing to have sex with a teenage boy. Now, this.Wonder how many more Trump folks are going to be exposed as sexual predators? Well, considering who their boss is, there s really no telling. All we can do is pop the popcorn and wait.

 Trump Makes Total Ass Of Himself While Trying To Exploit Wounded Vet Receiving Purple Heart (VIDEO),"Donald Trump decided that he would exploit a wounded vet to make himself look good, but as usual, all he ended up doing was making a total ass out of himself. Again.Trump was visiting Walter Reed Medical Center on Saturday. So he decided it would be great publicity if he personally awarded the Purple Heart to Army Sgt. 1st Class Alvaro Barrientos. Things were going pretty well until Trump congratulated him on being wounded in Afghanistan.You see, while the Purple Heart is indeed one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon someone serving in the U.S. military, it also means that the recipient was either wounded or killed. As such, it isn t exactly the type of thing you  congratulate  somebody on.Barrientos was one of four soldiers who was wounded when an Afghan soldier attacked their base in the Helmland province last month. As a result of his injuries, Barrientos lost his right leg, which had to be amputated at the knee. You honor that but you sure as hell don t  congratulate  it.Trump, accompanied by Melania, presented Barrientos with the Purple Heart during a small ceremony at the hospital. I heard about this and I wanted to do it myself,  said Trump.  Congratulations on behalf of Melania, myself, and the entire nation. Tremendous job. He may not think words matter, but here in the real world, they most certainly do. Especially when you are the commander-in-chief awarding the Purple Heart to a service member who just had a leg amputated fighting your country s wars. Next time Trump decides to use a wounded vet a photo-op, he should be just a bit more careful when choosing his words.You can watch Trump congratulate a wounded soldier for having his leg amputated, here:Pres.

So, he announced on Saturday that he plans to celebrate by throwing a  big rally  on his 100th day. Presumably, he expects a better turnout than he got for his pathetic inauguration.Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2017Rally will be to mark Trump s 100 days in office & organized/paid for by Trump s campaign committee, per senior campaign official https://t.co/wYW92Z8a87  Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) April 22, 2017So far, with 100 days under his belt, Trump hasn t managed to accomplish squat except for failing to follow through on his absurd campaign promises. Mexico isn t paying for his stupid wall. His Muslim Ban was shot down twice as bigoted and unconstitutional. Obamacare is still the law of the land. And he is known as the biggest recruiting tool ISIS has at the moment. Exactly why he thinks this warrants a party is unclear. But as can only be expected of a narcissist, he is somehow convinced that this is a great idea and it totally won t have an embarrassing turnout.It is worth pointing out that the day of Trump s  big rally  is the same night the White House Correspondents  Dinner will be taking place   without the man occupying the White House in attendance because the press hurt his feelings.On Friday, Trump tweeted that the 100-day mark is a  ridiculous standard. No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2017He then followed up by telling the press that it s  just an artificial barrier.  He added that since he didn t have the slightest clue how to actually president when he took office, he should be given extra leeway. He also noted that even though repealing Obamacare was one of his biggest campaign promises, he has really only been thinking about if for two months. I ve been here 92 days, but I ve only been working on the health care, you know, I had to get like a little bit of grounding, right?  Trump told the Associated Press.  Health care started after 30 day(s), so I ve been working on health care for 60 days. Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2017"
 KARMA: Wikileaks Turns On Donald Trump After Administration Threatens To Arrest Julian Assange,"Karma just kicked Donald Trump s door down.As you ll recall, Donald Trump repeatedly praised Wikileaks for leaking Hillary Clinton s campaign emails. Those leaks helped Trump win the election, but now Trump s love of Wikileaks has come back to bite him on the ass.Trump CIA Director Mike Pompeo and his Attorney General Jeff Sessions have both criticized Wikileaks since Trump took office and both have promised to arrest Wikileaks leader Julian Assange.Pompeo even admitted that Wikileaks is a  non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia. Indeed, Trump colluded with Russia to win the election.Sessions told reporters this week that he intends to put people like Assange in jail for leaks. We are going to step up our effort and already are stepping up our efforts on all leaks,  Sessions said.  This is a matter that s gone beyond anything I m aware of. Here s the video via Twitter.U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on bringing charges against Julian Assange pic.twitter.com/BudIEN2uK0https://t.co/LN04EvJ8FK  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 21, 2017And Trump himself recently declared that he supports the Justice Department effort to arrest and charge Assange, telling reporters that s it s  okay with me. So Wikileaks decided to hit back by posting video of Trump telling his rally crowd how much he loves Wikileaks.Donald Trump, October 10, 2016:  This just came out. WikiLeaks! I love WikiLeaks!  pic.twitter.com/KWP7X2aLiN  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 21, 2017Oops. Trump apparently forgot that he was in bed with Wikileaks during the election. He loved them for attacking Hillary Clinton for his own benefit. Now Wikileaks is probably regretting helping Trump because their leader is now being targeted by his administration. And Trump has to be concerned about Wikileaks digging up information on him and releasing it to the public.This is what karma looks like. Trump had no problem with Wikileaks when the organization was attacking Hillary. Now we get to see how Trump likes being attacked by them. This ought to be damn entertaining.Featured Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2017"
 Trump Demotes Career State Department Official After Breitbart Questions Her Loyalty To America,"McCarthyism has returned.Donald Trump is literally letting a white nationalist publication dictate personnel decisions in his administration.Sahar Nowrouzzadeh is an American citizen of Iranian descent. She is an expert on Iran and has played a crucial role in shaping U.S. policy in the Middle East. She was born in America, first served at the State Department under the George W. Bush administration in 2005 and was on the team that negotiated the Iran Nuclear Deal under President Obama.But because she is of Iranian descent, Breitbart and other conservative outlets believe she is in league with Iranian leadership against the United States. Seriously.According to Politico,Nowrouzzadehad had been detailed since last July to the secretary of state s policy planning team, where she handled ongoing issues related to Iran and Gulf Arab countries. Her yearlong assignment was cut short earlier this month, after critical stories about her and others appeared in the Conservative Review and on Breitbart News, according to the State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. Nowrouzzadeh did not want to be reassigned, according to the official.Indeed, being reassigned is basically a demotion and one based on racism and fear instead of one based on her job performance.Nowrouzzadeh will now be working in the Office of Iranian Affairs despite the State Department praising her work as  valuable in furtherance of U.S. national security. Nowrouzzadeh is the kind of State Department employee America needs right now as tensions between Iran and the United States remain strained because Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly threatened to trash the nuclear deal.Former State Department official Phillip Gordon slammed the Trump administration for caving to pressure from conservative media. Like many civil service experts and career foreign service officers, she possesses just the sort of expertise political leaders from either party should have by their side when they make critical and difficult foreign policy decisions,  Gordon said.The bottom line is that this smacks of McCarthyism from the right-wing just as it did when Joe McCarthy led a witch hunt against government employees in pursuit of alleged communists.Only this time, conservatives are targeting anyone who has a name that sounds Middle Eastern or Muslim.Breitbart should not have the power to affect personnel decisions at the State Department and Donald Trump should not listen to them. Doing so only makes us weaker because the experts we need on the front lines are being persecuted or living in fear of being persecuted.It also makes America less safe because this demotion will be used as an example of how the current United States government treats people of Middle Eastern descent in order to recruit terrorists.Sahar Nowrouzzadeh already swore an oath to defend the United States Constitution when she was hired by the State Department in 2005. It s the same oath that members of Congress swear when they enter office. Questioning her loyalty based on the color of her skin or her birth name is wrong and constitutes discrimination. Frankly, she should file a lawsuit against Trump.Featured Image: Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2017"
" Sarah Palin Faced Sexual Harassment At Fox News, But She Would Rather Protect The Network Than Say Something","When high-profile women like Sarah Palin stay silent, it enables sexual predators and puts more women at risk of being sexually harassed and assaulted.As Fox News continues to reel in the aftermath of Bill O Reilly s sexual harassment scandal just a year after the network dealt with Roger Ailes  own sexual harassment scandal, former contributors and anchors have been coming forward to tell their stories of how they were treated by their male colleagues there.But not Sarah Palin. Palin would rather pretend that nothing happened to her and that her male colleagues were totally professional and considerate.During an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN, Palin danced around the question of whether she experienced sexual harassment at the network and made it sound like her decision to leave Fox News was more about looking for different opportunities.TAPPER:  It sounds like you experienced something. PALIN:  I just   you know, it was just time to part ways and, and, you know, get   get out there in, I guess, a more diverse arena to express views. In fact, Palin had far stronger words for the victims who were repeatedly sexually harassed at Fox News than she did for the perpetrators. If a woman believes that she is being intimidated and harassed, she needs to stand up and do something about it and not stick around for a paycheck for years and years and years, and then after the fact complain about what she went through. Sarah Palin collected a paycheck for five years (2010-2015) from Fox News as a contributor and analyst.The sexual harassment was there from the start.In 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace remarked that  one can only hope  when asked if Palin would be sitting in his lap during an upcoming interview. Seriously.In 2011, Roger Ailes openly admitted that he only hired Palin  because she was hot and got ratings. Tucker Carlson, who has been with Fox News since 2009 and was just recently promoted to take Bill O Reilly s place, posted an incredibly sexist tweet about Palin in 2011 that he was forced to delete. Palin s popularity falling in Iowa, but maintains lead to become supreme commander in Milfistan,  Carlson wrote.In other words, things haven t changed much at all at Fox News. The network merely fired an old sexual predator and replaced him with a younger one.If Palin faced this much sexual harassment at the beginning it stands to reason that she faced it constantly throughout her time at the network. And she drew a paycheck for years without doing something about it and she continues to do nothing about it. She is protecting Fox News by staying silent and that puts women who still work there at risk.Palin then went on to shame other women who haven t spoken up and once again demonstrated that she is a hypocrite. As a strong woman, I say we should feel more empowered than that and take a stand and get out of the place and blow the whistle on the perpetrator doing the bad stuff so that the culture will change. But Palin herself refused to speak up and  blow the whistle  on the men who sexually harassed her at Fox News, and she just got done shaming the women who have come forward to actually blow the whistle.This is why Sarah Palin has zero credibility and why she is not a good role model for women.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 22, 2017"
" Chaffetz’s Decision To Quit Means Big Trouble For Trump, And Here’s Exactly How","Congressman Jason Chaffetz s decision to leave Congress means that bad things really are on the way for President Trump. If his presidency lasts the year, I will be shocked. I will eat a hat if that happens.Chaffetz has been a real star in the GOP. He is known for his ambition. Last November, he won about 74 percent of the vote in his district. He s young. He s good looking. He knows how to get all the right press and do what he needs to do to get ahead. Nothing in his actions in the past would indicate he wanted to leave Washington, DC. At least not yet. Rumors have been going around that he had his eyes on Senator Orrin Hatch s (R-UT) seat or possibly the governor s mansion in Utah. No one expected him to leave Congress so soon after winning reelection by such a large margin.At the same time, the Congressman has not been a true believer in Trump. Last fall, after the now infamous Billy Bush tape was released, he told ABC News,  I don t plan on voting for Donald Trump   this is quite the quandary what the nation s going to have to figure out. I m out, I can t support Trump after his lewd comments.  He went on to talk about his daughters and how he could not defend what Trump said about women. He later went back on that and said that he hated what Trump did but Hillary Clinton was just so much worse.At the start of 2017, things were looking good for the young Utah politician. Chaffetz was still the chairman of the powerful House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform. He had a fellow  Republican  in the White House. His Party had the House, the Senate and the White House. I can imagine him dreaming of all of the legislation he could push through this way.And then it all went wrong. Trump is not a real Republican. He has no real ideology. His only real allegiances are to his own ego and self interest. The things he says and promises he makes are valid only as long as he is voicing them. They then disappear into the proverbial ether. They have no meaning.This wasn t the problem, however. Since Inauguration Day, there have been more complaints and problems with the Trump Administration. Trump s ties to Russia are more than problematic, they could be treasonous. His financial dealings may not meet violations of law, he cannot have conflicts of interest legally. He can have them. He admitted in 2015 that he had a  big conflict of interest with Turkey because I have a hotel in Istanbul.  His frequent trips to Mar-a-Lago mean that the government is paying him every week to stay at his resort. He is still benefitting from all of his businesses and there is no reason to believe foreign leaders car a wit about the Emolument Clause. And these are just a few of the scandals that should be investigated by a committee like the one Chaffetz now heads.This has put Chaffetz in a really tough spot. He has access to information we all do not. If all of what do do know is as bad as it is, one only can wonder what things he has seen. On one hand, he cannot just step down from this committee. He cannot start investigations of a president in his own Party, especially if he knows they will blow it up. He also cannot be a party to Trump s misdeeds.This month, Chaffetz found his exit strategy. Quit Congress. He has done it slowly. First, he announces he will not seek reelection. Next, he hints that he may not serve out his term. His next move will be to quit all together. By August, he will be back in Utah. He has already taken several web domains like www.chaffetz2018.com. He claimed he wanted to be with his wife and children and that was why he was leaving. Keep in mind, his children have lived at home while he has been in Congress. That s ten years away from his kids when they lived at his house in Utah. By the summer, they will all be out of his house. So, this is when he goes back to see them more? Just after they all leave his home? No.Chaffetz sees the writing on the wall and does not want to be taken down by the same scandal that will end the Trump train wreck.Chaffetz isn t alone in this thinking. It was reported earlier this spring that Michael Steele, former chair of the RNC has been telling his clients to  start getting close to Pence. Former chairman of RNC Steele told WWR at lunch that .@RealDonaldTrump will not finish his term; advises clients to bolster ties w/VP Pence  West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) March 31, 2017Vice President Mike Pence has the same thought. His is a true believer Evangelical Christian. He once voted to take money away from HIV/AIDS funding to give it to  pray away the gay  programs. He does not go to events with women when alcohol is served, unless his wife is there. He has said he is worried he will  be tempted.  He made female staffers leave early so he would not be alone in the office with then. He could not have liked the comments that Trump grabbed women  by the pussy. Chaffetz had a bright future at the beginning of the year and the only way to make that still happen is to get the hell out of Dodge. So that s what he s doing.Featured image via Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2017"
" American Airlines Crew Hits Woman With Stroller, Challenges Passenger To Fight (VIDEO)","Yet another example of our airline industry s awesomeness occurred Friday when an employee was captured on video challenging a passenger to a fight after a woman holding a baby was hit with her stroller. The video begins with the crying woman holding one of her children in her arms while begging for her stroller back.One angry witness can be heard saying he s  not going to sit here and watch this  before going to the front of the plane to demand the name of the employee who hit the woman. Another woman on the flight can be heard confronting the staff about their treatment of the latest victim of airline violence. Much of the staff s conversation can not be heard from the vantage point of the person filming, but the gentleman who initially confronted the thugs on the plane stands up and says you do that to me and I ll knock you flat. You stay out of this!  the male flight attendant shot back. Try it. Hit me. You don t know what the story is.  But the passenger knew what the story is (the part that matters, anyway):I don t care what the story is. You almost hit that baby!Q13 Fox spoke to some of the people aboard the plane, and the story is just as terrible as it seems:Olivia Morgan was standing in the doorway of the aircraft with her 8-year-old daughter waiting to board when the altercation happened. The flight attendant wrestled the stroller away from the woman, who was sobbing, holding one baby with the second baby in a car seat on the ground next to her,  she said.Morgan said the flight attendant was  violent  when taking the metal stroller from the woman and nearly hit the baby with the stroller. He stormed by me with the stroller and I said something like,  What are you doing? You almost hit that baby!  And he yelled at me to  stay out of it!  just like he does in the video,  she said.Morgan said she talked to the woman about the incident. The woman said a female flight attendant told her she could look for space to store the stroller because it folds up very small, but if there was no available space, she would need to check it at the gate. She was looking for space when the male attendant tried to take it away from her  and she said she told him the other attendant had told her it was okay to look,  she said.According to the American Airlines website, small strollers can be checked at the gate but there is no policy about strollers in the overhead bin. The lady and her two children were seated near the back of the plane. She was somehow able to get her stroller on board and back near her seat,  said Tom Watson, who was sitting just behind the first class section when the staff went insane. She refused to let him take it and she was almost to the point of shouting. The flight attendant and the woman started making their way to the front of the plane. They were at the front of the plane near the crew area. The woman was holding on to the stroller and refusing to let go,  he continued, adding that The flight attendant should not have been so aggressive and should have been more aware of the kids. He then says the woman was escorted off the plane.Fortunately, American Airlines seems to have learned from United s numerous blunders following employees  assault on a doctor. Rather than attempt to blame the woman, the company released a statement announcing that the employee has been suspended (not terminated though):We have seen the video and have already started an investigation to obtain the facts. What we see on this video does not reflect our values or how we care for our customers. We are deeply sorry for the pain we have caused this passenger and her family and to any other customers affected by the incident. We are making sure all of her family s needs are being met while she is in our care. After electing to take another flight, we are taking special care of her and her family and upgrading them to first class for the remainder of their international trip.The actions of our team member captured here do not appear to reflect patience or empathy, two values necessary for customer care. In short, we are disappointed by these actions. The American team member has been removed from duty while we immediately investigate this incident.The woman had to take another flight, but was given upgraded accommodations.Watch video shot directly following the attack below: Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 22, 2017"
 Yale Psychiatrists Issue DIRE Warning Of The Dangers Of Allowing Trump To Continue As POTUS (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is not fit to be president. Most of the nation knows this. However, psychiatrists at Yale University   actual experts   have a warning for the United States Congress and the nation and world at large: Trump is mentally ill, and dangerously so.At a conference at the esteemed university, expressing this professional opinion was seen as a duty by this group of psychiatrists. They have described Trump as paranoid and delusional,  and that their statements were to warn of the dangers  of allowing Trump to continue to sit in the Oval Office. Dr. John Gartner, who spoke during the gathering at the School of Medicine at Yale, declared of Trump: We have an ethical responsibility to warn the public about Donald Trump s dangerous mental illness. Dr. Gartner is a member of a newly-formed organization of mental health experts called Duty to Warn. Their sole purpose is to convince as many people as possible that Donald Trump is mentally ill and must be removed from office before he does something truly dangerous to the nation and the world. Dr. Garten used Trump s ravings about his crowd sizes at his inauguration as just one piece of proof that he is too crazy to lead. He said of those statements: Worse than just being a liar or a narcissist, in addition he is paranoid, delusional and grandiose thinking and he proved that to the country the first day he was President. If Donald Trump really believes he had the largest crowd size in history, that s delusional. Dr. Bandy Lee, who teaches in the psychiatry department at Yale and headed up the conference where these statements were made, said of Trump: As some prominent psychiatrists have noted, [Trump s mental health] is the elephant in the room. I think the public is really starting to catch on and widely talk about this now. New York University psychiatrist James Gilligan had an even darker image of Trump to portray to the American people: I ve worked with some of the most dangerous people our society produces, directing mental health programs in prisons. I ve worked with murderers and rapists. I can recognize dangerousness from a mile away. You don t have to be an expert on dangerousness or spend fifty years studying it like I have in order to know how dangerous this man is. These are people who know what they are talking about. Sure, they may be violating the so-called  Goldwater Rule    meaning the unofficial rule that mental health professionals should not diagnose political figures in public   but they know what they see, and they must see something that is enough of a threat to the nation and world to speak out.Dr. Gartner has actually started a petition on the internet specifically for mental health professionals that requests that Congress exercise their Article I powers to get Trump out of the White House. It says: We, the undersigned mental health professionals (please state your degree), believe in our professional judgment that Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States. And we respectfully request he be removed from office, according to article 4 of the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which states that the president will be replaced if he is  unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office . Hopefully, someone with the sense to listen to these people does something about Trump before it is too late.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2017"
 Neil DeGrasse Tyson Gets Uncharacteristically Political; Says Trump Is A ‘Threat To Democracy’ (VIDEO),"Neil DeGrasse Tyson has always put science before politics, sometimes frustratingly so. Right after Trump was elected, Tyson appeared on Stephen Colbert s show, and rather than opine, he chose to try to comfort the host by saying that when you look at earth from outer space, our problems dissolve. He also said: The politician is representing an electorate. So, really, if you re against a politician, you re against their voter base, fellow citizens of this country,  he said.  So I as an educator, when I want to educate people, I don t say,  Don t vote for this person  or  Vote for that person.  I just simply educate you, so that when the time comes, you can make as informed a decision as you can. Now, though, Tyson is changing his tone. The Trump administration is clearly anti-science and it s anti-education. For Dr. Tyson, it s time to speak out   right before protesters across the nation are prepared to march for science. He posted this video to Facebook on Friday: Science is a fundamental part of the country that we are,  Tyson said.  When you have people who don t know much about science standing in denial of it and rising to power, that is a recipe for the complete dismantling of our informed democracy. While Tyson was clearly talking about Donald Trump, anti-GMO anti-vaxxer (often) liberals were taken to task as well.Tyson didn t deny that science has a place in politics. Once we agree, for example, that humans are causing climate change, we can debate how to fix the problem, but until we agree that there is a problem, we re screwed.Donald Trump s name wasn t mentioned at all during the four-minute video, and it didn t need to be. It was clear that Tyson was frustrated (dare I say angry?) that his career has been so politicized while he tries to stay on the sidelines. Tyson is a true hero.Featured image via Joe Scarnici/Getty Images.",News,"April 22, 2017"
" The White House Just Tried To Pretend Trump Was WINNING, IMMEDIATELY Regrets It (DETAILS)","Earlier today, Donald Trump whined about being held to a  ridiculous standard  in his first 100 days as POTUS, despite spending two years bragging about all the things he would get done in his first 100 days. By now most of us know that Trump has hardly accomplished anything during his first several weeks in the White House, and there have been far more failures than successes.Now, the White House is joining in on the mounting pressure for Trump to actually do something before his first 100 days come to an end. The Trump administration is now bending over backwards to make it seem as if Trump s presidency isn t the massive failure we all know it is   and of course they had to lie to make that possible.The White House has just claimed that Congress is going to vote on healthcare and tax reform next week, and that the government will be open despite the fact that the Republicans don t have any votes lined up and Congress will only be in session for half the week. According to CNBC: The White House hopes language on a possible health-care deal can come as early as Friday or Saturday, leaving the potential for an agreement next week, a White House official told CNBC. The Senate Budget Committee is assisting with the draft, which would be introduced first in the House. This is absolutely insane, and clearly a response to the fact that Trump hasn t accomplished anything in his first 100 days and the Trump administration is desperate to have something to show for it. In just 4 days, Trump expects the House to vote on health care, examine Trump s tax plan, and keep the government open just so he can have at least one win. That s not going to happen, and the American people know it.

 Trump Is Trying To Force Dems’ Hand On Border Wall Funding – Here’s Why He’ll Fail BIGLY,"Donald Trump seems to think he can squeeze Congressional Democrats for border wall funding by offering them something in exchange, and he also seems to believe he s hit the jackpot on just what to exchange. He ll hold subsidy payments to insurers on the Obamacare exchanges hostage until Democrats agree to fund his wall. If they continue to stonewall, then, when the ACA s insurance marketplace implodes or the government shuts down (or both), he ll blame Democrats and the whole country will, too.He s not seeing both sides, though. The Democrats actually hold all the good cards here.Why? Surely we can see how both sides have a decent hand, can t we? Trump s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, even said: We d offer them $1 of CSR payments for $1 of wall payments. Right now that s the offer that we ve given to our Democratic colleagues. A one-for-one trade sounds nice and equitable, doesn t it? Trump gets his wall and we get continued stability in the health insurance market, and the government keeps operating. Here s what he s not seeing: Democrats aren t the only ones who don t want to waste money on a big wall along the southern border. Many Republicans don t, either, and that gives Democrats major leverage over Trump.Chuck Schumer s spokesman issued a statement that said: The White House gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans, in order to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the President said would be paid for by Mexico is a complete non-starter.[I]f the administration would drop their 11th-hour demand for a wall that Democrats   and a good number of Republicans   oppose, Congressional leaders could quickly reach a deal. Some in the GOP have privately said that it would help if the Trump White House would move on from the border wall because there are too many in Congress who don t want to fund it. Furthermore, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are busy working toward creating a more bipartisan spending bill. But they know that, with control of the entire federal government, they will own a healthcare disaster and they will own a shutdown no matter what Trump decides to say about it.Republicans want to avoid a shutdown   they ve long since figured out that the country blamed them for the 2013 shutdown. That means working with Democrats, including scrapping funding for the wall if doing so means Democrats will agree to other things.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recognizes that Democrats have all the leverage here, and that they need to use that leverage to their advantage. Republicans control both Congress and the White House   people are not going to blame Democrats for a shutdown or for destabilizing the insurance marketplace under these circumstances.Mulvaney actually thinks that Congress should get out of the way of Trump s agenda: This president should be allowed to have his highest priorities funded even though the Democrats rightly have a seat at the table because of the Senate rules. The border wall is a non-starter and possibly dead, at least for now. There are more important things to think about than a wall that won t do anything that Trump claims it will.Featured image by Shawn Thew   Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 21, 2017"
" Hillary UNLOADS On Trump For Attacking Human Rights, Shows GOP Who SHOULD Have Been POTUS (VIDEO)","On Thursday, Hillary Clinton ripped Donald Trump and his bigoted administration apart for being on the wrong side of history and refusing to defend LGBT rights   and while she was at it, she showed conservatives just what they missed out on by letting a former reality television star get into the White House instead of a well-qualified politician.At a fundraiser for LGBT community organization The Center, Clinton received an award and gave a speech in which she thanked her audience for their continued support. However, her message came with a chilling warning about the Trump administration as she said the progress that we fought for, that many of you were on the front lines for. It may not be as secure as we once expected.  Clinton blasted Trump: We may not ever be able to count on this administration to lead on LGBT issues. Then, she couldn t resist rattling off several of the things Trump has been doing to directly attack and weaken the LGBT community. She said: When this administration rescinded protections for transgender students, my heart broke. When I learned about the proposed cuts in funding for HIV and AIDS research, I thought about all of our efforts to try and achieve an AIDS-free generation. Some of the changes that we re seeing should seem small, but they matter a great deal if you re the person affected. Others carry historic significance, like the future of the Supreme Court. While Clinton was not always a supporter of same-sex marriage, she had changed her tone several years ago and has been a powerful ally since. In her usual classy way, she called on Americans to stick together and unite to protect human rights and resist homophobia. Clinton said: I know the election hit a lot of us hard. I can tell you this: Even when it feels tempting to pull the covers over your heads, please keep going. Clinton s skilled and powerful delivery is something that Trump could only dream to emulate one day. Despite having lost the election to Trump, the majority of Americans still love and support Clinton, as Trump s approval rating plummets by the day. The support for her message shows that America no longer supports the values of the GOP any longer, and that conservatives have made a major mistake by putting Trump in the White House.You can watch Clinton s speech below: Featured image via Drew Angerer and Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News,"April 21, 2017"
 Sarah Palin And Her White Trash Friends Get TORCHED For Disrespecting Hillary Clinton’s White House Portrait,"It s bad enough they were even allowed to step foot in the White House.But Sarah Palin, Kid Rock, and Ted Nugent also decided to stand in front of Hillary Clinton s portrait and completely disrespect it.When two gay activists raised their middle fingers toward Ronald Reagan s White House portrait a few years ago, conservatives threw a collective temper tantrum over it. They complained for days about the utter lack of respect shown toward Reagan. Of course, Reagan s inaction during the AIDS epidemic during his presidency understandably angers many people.However, two gay activists from Philadelphia is not the same as three people who are public figures. Nugent and Kid Rock are both musicians and Palin is a former vice-presidential candidate.As such, they are and should be held to a higher standard.Sarah Palin was invited to the White House by Donald Trump, who told her to bring some friends. For some reason, she chose Nugent, a man who shit his pants to avoid serving his country in Vietnam and later wrote an ode to pedophilia, and Robert Ritchie (Kid Rock), an alcoholic who has committed assault and battery and has a sex tape.Seriously, these people got to pal around in the Oval Office. It s disgraceful.But the trio did more than that. Instead of just acting like adults for the day, they decided to act like complete jackasses by mocking Hillary Clinton s White House portrait. Hillary Clinton has a White House portrait because she was the First Lady. And a classy First Lady at that, unlike Melania Trump, whom you can find nude photos of simply by running a search on Google.In the photo, Nugent holds his thumb out as if to say Clinton is  outta here  while Palin had a look of disgust on her face. Ritchie merely folded his arms across his chest in disdain.Here s the photo via Facebook:Of course, conservatives are cheering about this utter lack of disrespect even though they would have thrown a massive hissy fit had three liberal celebrities done the same to a portrait of a Republican First Lady.Most Americans, however, did not appreciate Palin and her friends  disrespect of a former First Lady.Again, Sarah Palin is a quitter and grifter who will never work in the White House. Ted Nugent is a racist who has a thing for underage girls. And Kid Rock is the poster boy for who the war on drugs should be waged against. Donald Trump degraded the White House by inviting these three losers to visit and he should be ashamed of himself for once again demonstrating why America is a laughingstock around the world.Featured Image: Facebook",News,"April 21, 2017"
 Hawaii Attorney General HUMILIATES Jeff Sessions For Whining About Judge On ‘Island In The Pacific’,"Donald Trump s Attorney General just got schooled on the Constitution.Earlier this week, Jeff Sessions bitched about a judge  on an island in the Pacific  having the power to block an executive order. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power,  Sessions said.Of course, Sessions is a hypocrite because he cheered on judges who blocked executive orders issued by President Obama.But because the order was issued by his rich white boss, Sessions is all of a sudden complaining.Judge Derrick Watson stood up to Trump and his racist administration a couple months ago by blocking parts of the immigration ban that barred Muslims from certain nations from entering the country. Trump s ban caused international chaos and violated the civil rights of thousands.Hawaii is not merely an  island in the Pacific,  however. It s also an official state under the same Constitution that Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump violate on a daily basis.In the Constitution, the founding fathers created the Judicial Branch of our government to serve as a check on executive and legislative power. The judiciary has the power to review executive orders and laws and can block and strike them down if they are found to be unconstitutional.Judge Watson exercised his judicial power.Sessions  statement is a disgraceful attempt to undermine the judicial branch.Hawaii Attorney General Dougal Chin fired back at Sessions on Thursday by explaining how the Constitution works. President Trump previously called a federal judge in California a so-called judge. Now U.S. Attorney General Sessions appears to dismiss a federal judge in Hawaii as just a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific. Our Constitution created a separation of powers in the United States for a reason. Our federal courts, established under Article III of the Constitution, are co-equal partners with Congress and the President. It is disappointing Sessions does not acknowledge that. Indeed, America needs an Attorney General who actually understands the Constitution, and Sessions clearly does not.One of Sessions  Justice Department lackeys even tried to pathetically clarify the offensive remarks. Hawaii is, in fact, an island in the Pacific a beautiful one where the Attorney General s granddaughter was born. The point, however, is that there is a problem when a flawed opinion by a single judge can block the President s lawful exercise of authority to keep the entire country safe. Wrong. If Trump and his administration think the ruling is flawed then they should seek opinions from higher courts. That s how the system works. The White House and Justice Department can t just ignore a court ruling because they disagree with it. Also, national security should not be used as an excuse to ignore the Constitution. That s a slippery slope to tyranny. If that excuse were acceptable Trump and Sessions would use it all the time to justify anything and everything they do.Jeff Sessions should be embarrassed for attacking the judicial branch the way he did and he definitely deserved the humiliation he has been receiving. Frankly, he should resign in disgrace.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 21, 2017"
 Stephen Colbert SCORCHES Jeff Sessions’ Racism In One Brilliant Tweet,"Late Show host Stephen Colbert is no fan of Donald Trump and his administration of bigots. Therefore, he was, of course, incensed at Attorney General Jeff Sessions  racist attack on a sitting federal judge regarding Trump s bigoted Muslim Ban.Judge Derrick Watson infamously blocked Trump s Muslim Ban 2.0, and in the decision he said the whole thing read like a   neon sign flashing  Muslim ban, Muslim ban. On Thursday, Sessions went full dog whistle when he criticized Judge Watson s decision, saying the following: We are confident that the president will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power. Of course, that brings back the fact that accusations of racism have dogged Sessions for decades, and rightly so. He is a throwback to a time we really should be trying to get away from, and here he is, the nation s top law enforcement officer. Shameful, but true. Therefore, Stephen Colbert s tweet on the matter is more than fitting:Sessions is ""amazed"" an ""island in the Pacific"" judge can block the travel ban. Just like how I'm ""bewildered"" a ""racist elf"" can be AG.  Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) April 21, 2017That is exactly what Jeff Sessions is   a stone cold racist. A stone cold racist who is now in charge of the civil liberties of the citizens of the United States of America. You really can t make this stuff up.Thank you for telling it like it is, Mr. Colbert.

Roosevelt s first few months after taking the oath. But really, we can t blame the former reality show star for wanting to forgo the tradition considering how horrifying Trump s nearly 100 days in office has been. As for his accomplishments, we re not seeing any. And in comparison to former President Barack Obama, Trump looks like an amateur.Early this morning Trump tweeted,  No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!

Perhaps he s referring to Georgia where Democrat Jon Ossoff outperformed every Republican candidate in the deep red district but he just didn t pay the 50 percent mark to avoid a runoff. Or maybe Trump is talking about Neil Gorsuch. It s hard to tell.Trump s 100th day may begin with a government shutdown if Congress fails to approve a new spending deal.Obama passed 11 laws during his first 100 days in office. So far, Trump has focused on reversing vital things that his predecessor has done for this country, including Internet privacy and health care, among others. The bigot-in-chief failed twice to pass a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. Trump is inundated with scandals, including his administration s possible collusion with a hostile foreign government to interfere in our election process.The Internet reacted to Trump s tweet:Trump says the first 100 days is a ""ridiculous standard""Signed legislation compared.

 Trump HUMILIATED Over Name-Drop That’s Worse Than Frederick Douglass Gaffe (TWEETS),"Is The Donald really this oblivious to the entire world? And history? And, well, everything? Two and a half months after embarrassing himself by implying that Frederick Douglass was still alive, he embarrasses himself by dropping the name of yet another famous person who has passed away   Luciano Pavarotti. He didn t just imply that Pavarotti is still living today (he died of pancreatic cancer ten years ago). While he and Italy s prime minister held a joint press conference, he must have decided to praise Italy for the gift of Pavarotti (or rather, he decided to use Pavarotti to puff himself up and appear more superior) by saying: Pavarotti, friend of mine, great friend of mine. First off, as stated before, Pavarotti is no longer gracing the world with his amazing tenor voice. Twitter made a point of reminding Trump of that:@kylegriffin1 @colattesipper @MSNBC Which is when I wish that Trump had died, instead of Pavarotti. Since at least Pavarotti could sing, and Trump can t do anything ..sad!

Suzanne Munshower (@expatina) April 20, 2017@IMPL0RABLE @teka21bat Trump s presser with Italian PM is so cringe worthy, his good friend Pavarotti can t even stand to watch it.  (((Shelley Rivlin))) (@srivlin) April 20, 2017But it s also not likely that Pavarotti was any friend of Trump s at all. Trump repeatedly used a recording of him singing Puccini s  Nessun Dorma  during his campaign, and his family asked Trump to stop.  Nessun Dorma  means  None Shall Sleep,  and Pavarotti s rendition has a climax where he sings  Vincero  three times, which means  I will win. We all know how Trump likes to  win. The family issued a statement that said: As members of his immediate family, we would like to recall that the values of brotherhood and solidarity which Luciano Pavarotti expressed throughout the course of his artistic career are entirely incompatible with the world view offered by the candidate Donald Trump. Trump may well have met Pavarotti at some point, but one would think that, if they had been great friends, he would have at least been able to act like he knew Pavarotti was gone. The family may also have taken that into account regarding the use of Pavarotti s aria at rallies if it were true.So not only did he again demonstrate that he doesn t know a damn thing about anything that goes on, and he likely lied about being great friends with that man. Pavarotti was a great man. Trump is an insecure, pathetic fraction of a man.Watch below:Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2017"
" WATCH: Trump Directs Childish Tantrum At Canada, Prime Minister Trudeau Shows Him How An Adult Acts","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau just demonstrated that he s the adult in the room when it comes to dealing with Donald Trump.In remarks from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump launched a childish attack on our northern neighbor and longtime ally over the dairy industry in yet another overall assault on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). I want to end and add by saying that Canada   what they ve done to our dairy farm workers is a disgrace,  Trump began.  It s a disgrace. I spent time with some of the farmers in Wisconsin   and as you know, rules, regulations, different things, have changed; and our farmers in Wisconsin and New York State are being put out of business   our dairy farmers. The fact is, NAFTA   whether it s Mexico or Canada   is a disaster for our country. It s a disaster. It s a trading disaster,  Trump continued.  We can t let Canada or anybody else take advantage, and do what they do to our workers and to our farmers. We re going to have to get to the negotiating table with Canada very, very quickly this is another NAFTA disaster, and we re not going to let it continue onward. Here s the video via YouTube:Trump s tantrum drew a sharp but very adult response from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who told Bloomberg that he  understands  that governors in the border states are playing politics with the dairy issue, but then he pointed out that America  has a $400 million dairy surplus with Canada. In other words, the supply of milk in the United States has surpassed demand, which means farmers can t sell any more because there is already too much milk on the market. So it s not Canada that is the challenge here,  Trudeau continued, adding that we need to base our trading relationships on the facts so that people in both countries can succeed.Trudeau further pointed out that the United States subsidizes much of the agriculture industry and that we should  not pretend we re in a global free market when it comes to agriculture. Every country protects, for good reason, its agricultural industries. Trudeau went on to say that Canada is not going to  overreact,  but will instead  lay out the facts  and hold substantive talks about how Canada, Mexico, and the United States can fix some of the issues with NAFTA that need tweaking. Trudeau even addressed Trump directly by stating that once Trump is presented the facts he ll  take a different position. He has shown if he says one thing and actually hears good counter arguments or good reasons why he should shift his position, he will take a different position if it s a better one, if the arguments win him over,  Trudeau said.Here s the video via YouTube:Once again, Trump embarrasses himself and the United States.

" GOP FURIOUS As Repeal FAILS, Americans Now Prefer Obamacare Over Entire Republican Party (IMAGE)","Not too long ago, the Republican Party and Donald Trump made a disgusting move to screw over millions of Americans when they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) with the American Health Care Act (Trumpcare). The plan fortunately didn t work out and was shot down immediately, leaving the GOP stunned and upset that their disastrous bill didn t pass. They ve just been delivered another devastating blow, this time by Americans who are showing the Republican Party they haven t forgotten.Thanks to the GOP s unethical Obamacare replacement, Obamacare is now more popular than ever   more popular than the Republican Party as a whole!Ezra Klein tweeted this amazing graph to illustrate:This is going to tear Trump and the GOP apart, considering how desperate they were to get rid of Obamacare. The overwhelming support that the Affordable Care Act is receiving now will surely make it harder for Republicans to get rid of it in the future, if they dare try again.This serves as a major warning to the GOP   if they keep trying to get rid of Obama s legacy and policies that clearly work, their party will lose all support and soon there will be no Republican Party. If conservatives thought they would have Americans standing behind them during their attempt to repeal a health care law that provides access to more Americans than ever, they ve just learned that they were very, VERY wrong.The GOP has no idea how badly the party has been damaged under Trump. He is completely obsessed with pushing legislation through, and it has been working against the Republican Party as each attempt of his fails and the party becomes more unpopular than ever. With the introduction of Trumpcare, Republicans have basically paved the way for Democrats to get Congress back in two years, and getting Trump out of the White House.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2017"
" Chaffetz Says Screw Congress, Might Leave Before His Term Is Up (DETAILS)","House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), doesn t think he wants to be a Congressman anymore. He already dropped jaws when he announced that he would not be running for Congress again, but now he says he might not even finish out his term and may just run for the hills instead.Speaking to KSL News Radio s Doug Wright on Thursday, Chaffetz said he hasn t decided what he is going to do yet, but he might choose not to finish out his term. He made it clear that he still hasn t made up his mind about what he will do and is taking into consideration what the state of Utah would have to do to replace him if he walks away from his seat. I will continue to weigh the options, but I might depart early,  Chaffetz told the radio host.On Wednesday, Chaffetz made the announcement that he would not be running for either the House or Senate in 2018. However, at no point has he tried to rule out the possibility of a future run for another office, such as governor of Utah, for example.At this point, his office has not returned requests for comment or released an official statement. Chaffetz is currently serving his fifth term. If he chooses to remain in Congress, he would be able to serve as House Oversight Committee Chairman until 2020 according to the House GOP s present rules, which limit committee chairs to three terms.Chaffetz said he is considering abandoning his career in Congress because he wants to spend more time with his family and is ready to return to the private sector. If he does decide to leave, the race to fill his seat as chairman of the Oversight Committee will commence. So far, no one on the powerful committee has been willing to publicly confirm whether they would be interested in taking his place as chairman.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2017"
 AG Sessions Directs Disgusting Insult At Hawaii After Hawaiian Judge Blocks Trump’s Muslim Ban,"Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions is as furious as Trump is over the blocking of an executive order that would have denied Muslims entry into the United States. Rather than reassess their own morality, the Islamophobic tag team has gone after the judges who have pointed out their plans are unconstitutional. For Trump, a former reality tv star and current 70-year-old Fox News viewer, the inability to understand the basics of America s justice system is pretty much a given, but his Attorney General seems just as clueless   and it s literally his job to understand the law.Highlighting his sheer incompetence to perform the job he was handpicked to do, Sessions (formerly an Alabama senator best known for being a racist) slammed the state of Hawaii and discounted its importance in the United States with a shocking rant during an interview with right-wing conspiracy theorist Mark Levin: We ve got cases moving in the very, very liberal Ninth Circuit, who, they ve been hostile to the order,  Sessions said.  We won a case in Virginia recently that was a nicely-written order that just demolished, I thought, all the arguments that some of the other people have been making. We are confident that the President will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power. That judge  sitting on an island in the Pacific  Sessions was so quick to dismiss? He s a federal judge working in a federal court in the U.S. state of Hawaii. Hardly a random nobody.As ever, the Trump administration s go-to defense of their badly botched policies is to attack the critics for not letting them do whatever they want. Trump s so-called  travel ban  would have overtly banned many Muslims from entering the United States based exclusively on their religion and ethnicity. The Constitution is pretty clear on that. The ruling was so straightforward that it was actually confirmed by several other federal judges before Trump announced that he was dropping his stab at it and starting over.And given Sessions  track record, it is a bit more odious that he would choose to go after the  island in the Pacific  populated by a diverse group of Americans. Racist dog whistles aren t supposed to be this loud.UPDATE: As reporters have pointed out, Sessions  smear on Judge Derrick Watson is even more obviously partisan because he actually voted for him.FYI Jeff Sessions voted to confirm Derrick Watson, the federal judge he's now attacking as ""a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific"". pic.twitter.com/kfeL4ZoKrP  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 20, 2017Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2017"

 Voters Prefer America’s Most Hated Airline Over Donald Trump,"The current occupant of the White House has finally accomplished something for his first 100 days in office; he s considered by American voters to be worse than the country s most hated airline. United just can t stay out of the news. In late March, a United Airlines agent at Denver International Airport stopped two teenage girls from boarding a flight because they wore leggings. Earlier this month a passenger was violently dragged from his seat and down the aisle because the flight was overbooked. That man, a doctor, had to go to the hospital after the incident. Also, earlier this month, a man on a United flight back from Mexico was falsely accused of trafficking his white daughter.Trump is even more unfavorable than United Airlines.A whopping 42 percent of those surveyed by Public Policy Polling (PPP) say they prefer United more than Trump. In contrast, 40 percent favor Trump.We re sure the former reality show star won t be touting these numbers on his Twitter timeline:Pollsters found generally negative attitudes toward United, with 47 percent viewing it unfavorably. Twenty-three percent see the airline favorably.PPP discovered Trump fares worse than United, with 52 percent of respondents considering him unfavorably and 43 percent favorably.In the survey, United was ranked as America s worst airline. The aforementioned 69-year-old doctor s attorney said his client suffered a concussion, broken nose and lost two teeth during the incident.Trump s poll numbers are abysmally low, even in other surveys. The most recent one done by Pew Research shows the alleged president still garnering historically low approval numbers for any president during his first 90 days on the job.To put this in perspective, at this same point in Barack Obama s presidency, four times as many Republicans approved of him as Democrats who approve of Trump now.There is a difference between United and Trump. United feigns to be a caring airline in its ads, then drags customers off their flights without consequence. Trump is treating people exactly as he said he would. Nothing he does comes as a surprise to any of us. That is, unless you weren t paying attention during his campaign.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2017"
 Exxon Mobil Brazenly Attempts To Use Administration To Grant Russian Favors,"During Watergate, the line became  follow the money.  In the Trump, Russia scandal, you can bet that investigators are following the money. In fact, the for-profit scheme is so brazen that the Trump administration, which is packed with oligarchs, is flaunting it.Not only is the Trump administration blatantly profiting off of the office of the presidency, but Exxon Mobil, the company that used to have Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at its helm, is asking for a waiver so they can profit in Russia.This is beginning to sound a bit like deja vu; a Trump meets with a foreign leader and mysteriously, new business ventures open for Trumpsters.Of course, it s one thing is that country is actually a trading partner   then only the Emoluments Clause is brought into question   but when members of the Trump administration attempt to do business with Russia, a country with whom our relationship can best be defined as  it s complicated,  (we have sanctions againt them) more than a few eyebrows are raised. They aren t even pretending anymore. Exxon wants to drill in Russia and you can be sure that if it were just up to the Trump administration, they would be granted their application, despite the fact that they were denied just two years ago.Exxon has been seeking U.S. permission to drill with Rosneft in several areas banned by sanctions and renewed a push for approval in March, shortly after its most recent chief executive, Rex Tillerson, became secretary of state on Feb. 1, according to one of these people. The company originally applied for a waiver to gain access to the Black Sea in July 2015 but its application wasn t approved, the person said.Source: Wall Street JournalWhile Tillerson has recused himself for two years on anything regarding his old company, the people who work for him in the State Department will be processing the application.The only thing standing in the way of the application is our very corporate friendly Republican Congress, although, at a time when they are investigating Russian ties, granting permission might not be the best way to win over voters. They are investigating connections between Trump s administration and Russia. It certainly doesn t look good that right after Trump snatches Tillerson from Exxon Mobil, they ask for favors from the government. Did I mention that Tillerson has what the Wall Street Journal describes as a  close working relationship  with Russia s President Vladimir Putin?The best response to the request did come from one Republican, though.

 New Research Shows Trump’s Border Wall Will Be Even MORE Worthless Than We Thought (DETAILS)," Build the wall! Build the wall!  Supposedly nobody builds better walls than Donald Trump, and the government is already hard at work acquiring the land and materials necessary to build a wall that s likely to do nothing to stop people from crossing the southern border. Now, a new study shows that the border wall may also be more a more unjustified waste of money than ever.Illegal immigration has been falling since 2007, but this latest bit of research out of the University of California, San Diego, says it will continue to fall. It s partly because of Obama   contrary to what xenophobic conservatives say, Obama did not favor or enable an open border. He made stemming the flow of immigrants a priority of his administration. The right wing is pissed because he also worked to protect people who were already here.However, the biggest causes of the drop are actually far more subtle and beyond the control of even the most hard-line, xenophobic White House. Economic trends, such as falling demand for low-skilled workers, play a huge role too. That s a long-term trend that these researchers don t see reversing itself anytime soon.There s also a major demographic component to this   our baby boom ended rather quickly in the early 1960s. However, in Latin America, it fell off far more gradually, resulting in a much larger number of younger Latin American workers who could find better opportunities here, in the 1990s and early 2000s, than in their home countries.That also is no longer true. The birth rate in Latin America is now about the same as ours, resulting in a falloff in the number of people trying to come here for opportunity. Furthermore, the population of undocumented immigrants that we do have is aging. Over the next few decades, they ll be forced to either start paying ridiculous medical bills out of pocket, or they ll find themselves forced to return to their home countries.If you combine these factors, the number of people trying to cross the border illegally will continue to drop. In fact, the researchers believe it will fall sharply over the next 20 years even without a wall.And yet, here s Trump and all his loyal subjects still chanting that a wall, which will cost anywhere from $21 billion to $70 billion and take years to build, is absolutely necessary to securing the border. But nobody actually knows how much money we could waste on this wall because no reliable estimates exist. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, there are too  many variables that are currently unknown  to be able to accurately estimate this cost.Yet they re asking for $2.6 billion for just 71 miles of new barriers for FY2018. That s a lot of money for less than 100 miles of barrier.We already knew that we, the taxpayers, were going to foot the bill for something that s probably not going to work. But now we re going to foot the bill for something that isn t just ineffective, but is wholly unnecessary.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"April 19, 2017"
 Patriots White House Group Photo Sure To Infuriate Trump After Obama Comparison Surfaces,"It s no secret that Donald Trump has deep insecurities about his job performance compared to his predecessor. Making matters worse, Trump s favorability continues to take a nosedive while former president Barack Obama is seeing a post-office surge. America got its first example of just how thin-skinned and vain Trump really would be as president when he repeatedly lied (and had his staff lie) about the size of his inauguration crowd.We re about to get a second glimpse.On Wednesday, Trump hosted the New England Patriots football team at the White House in honor of the Super Bowl win. However, not everyone made the trip. Months ago, players started announcing that they would boycott the trip due to Trump s divisive rhetoric. His history of racism, sexism, xenophobia and intolerance were enough to make many players not want to lend their support to his presidency.In an additional blow, Trump s idol Tom Brady decided (last minute) that he would not be attending the ceremony either. Brady s official excuse was  family  reasons. It s unclear if there was another, more Trump-related reason. The news was probably devastating to Trump, who has long considered Brady one of his few friends.As a result of the boycotts, Trump s group photo with the Patriots was noticeably sparse. It looked even worse when the New York Times dug up the 2015 Patriots White House visit.

" BREAKING: It’s Real, Russia Stole Our Election And Now Officials Have Definitive PROOF","While we don t yet have the smoking gun that specifically says Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win the presidency, US officials now have the blueprint that the Russians used to ensure that Hillary Clinton lost the election, and much of it will sound very familiar.According to three current and four former US officials, a Russian think tank controlled by Vladimir Putin used tried and true KGB tactics to make sure the election went exactly as they wanted.They described two confidential documents from the think tank as providing the framework and rationale for what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an intensive effort by Russia to interfere with the Nov. 8 election. U.S. intelligence officials acquired the documents, which were prepared by the Moscow-based Russian Institute for Strategic Studies [en.riss.ru/], after the election.Source: ReutersThe first of the two documents was written in June. It didn t specifically mention Donald Trump, but it did outline a plan of using social media to sour voters toward any candidate who would share President Obama s hardline stance toward Russia.The second document was from October, just a month before the election:A second institute document, drafted in October and distributed in the same way, warned that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win the election. For that reason, it argued, it was better for Russia to end its pro-Trump propaganda and instead intensify its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the U.S. electoral system s legitimacy and damage Clinton s reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency, the seven officials said.In other words, all the anti-Hillary, anti-DNC crap you heard during the election was straight out of Putin s playbook. From the right, while Trump was making accusations of voter fraud, you can be sure that his marching orders were coming from the Kremlin.The US officials are still remaining anonymous and American intelligence agencies are not commenting right now, but it s clear without Russia s campaign of fake news and their attempt to undermine confidence in our electoral system was exactly what Trump needed to win. The hacking wasn t part of the blueprint, but that was icing on the cake that came from another Kremlin source.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News,"April 19, 2017"
" Trump Takes Credit For Republican ‘Win’ In Georgia, And Gets Brutally Humiliated With Math","You would think that a businessman would understand math. Not Donald Trump.Democratic congressional candidate Jon Ossoff narrowly missed an outright victory in Georgia on Tuesday.As Republicans poured money into the race, Ossoff s anti-Trump campaign soared and nearly cruised to an easy win in a district that is considered a Republican fortress.In other words, Ossoff should not have been able to even get close to winning. But Donald Trump s increasing unpopularity combined with his incompetence gave Democrats a strategy to become competitive in even the most conservative areas.After being upset in Delaware and nearly losing in Kansas, Republicans had much to be worried about on Tuesday as election results flowed in.Even Trump recognized that the race in Georgia represents a backlash against his administration and Republican power in Congress, which is why he attacked Ossoff repeatedly on Twitter.It s a test of what Republicans could expect in 2018 when the midterm election rolls around.Instead of a Republican wave, however, the current party that controls Congress could be swept out of power by a Democratic wave, paving the way for Trump s impeachment and the reversal of the destructive policies he and his Republican friends in Congress have put in place so far.In the end, Ossoff did not secure the 50 percent of the vote needed to win. The election now heads to a runoff in June between Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel.But that didn t stop Trump from declaring that race a victory for Republicans and taking credit for it.Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG  R  win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2017Dems failed in Kansas and are now failing in Georgia. Great job Karen Handel! It is now Hollywood vs. Georgia on June 20th.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2017The problem is that Democrats did not  fail.  Ossoff captured 48 percent of the vote in a district that should have easily been won by Republicans. Handel only got 19 percent of the vote and Ossoff got more votes than just about every Republican on the ticket combined.Twitter users were more than happy to humiliate Trump s math skills.@realDonaldTrump Dems didn t  fail  in Georgia. The  super liberal  Democrat @ossoff got more votes than every single Republican by far. #FactsMatter pic.twitter.com/9ToZdC7Zlq  William LeGate (@williamlegate) April 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump They did  but .sweetie Republicans are failing in those districts to win by same margins as they did before YOU came along.  Erich McElroy (@erichmcelroy) April 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump He got 48% of the vote twice as much as Handel.  Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) April 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump By  failing  you mean how well Ossoff did despite tons of dark money spending by the Reps in Rep territory. Alright.  Anirvan Ghosh (@anirvanghosh) April 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump Just for the record, Ossoff won twice the number of popular votes as Handel. That s called a  win .  Anirvan Ghosh (@anirvanghosh) April 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump You should ask Ossoff how it feels to actually win the popular vote.

(@ljtost) April 19, 2017@Mike_P_Williams @realDonaldTrump I don t ever remember @BarackObama repeatedly bashing every person that didn t vote for him. Probably because he was a decent person, though  Dana Smith (@Brady5thOrBust) April 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump Are you kidding me? Are you unable to comprehend basic math? Dems have the most votes in GA. What is wrong with you?  ? (@VeeVee) April 19, 2017@realdonaldtrump  Fail . You keep using this word. I do not think it means what you think it means. pic.twitter.com/iyewM44nC3  Howdy Doody (@DanHowdle) April 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump #Ossoff got a bigger percentage of the vote than you did.
