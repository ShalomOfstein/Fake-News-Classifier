 Trump UNRAVELS As Republicans Admit He Should Spend Less Time Playing Golf (DETAILS),"By now, pretty much all of America can agree that Donald Trump needs to spend more time working and less time on the golf course   and it s not just the Democrats who think this. Apparently, there is now a big push from the Republican Party to get Trump to spend less time at Mar-a-Lago.Republican Joni Ernst confessed that the GOP is having a hard time defending all the time Trump is spending away from his responsibilities at the White House. At an Iowa town hall, Ernst admitted that the GOP as a whole believes that Trump should drastically cut down on his costly getaways: I do wish he would spend more time in Washington, DC. That s what we have the White House for, we would love to see more of those State Department visits in Washington, DC. I think it s smart that he does business in Washington DC, so I ve had those same concerns myself. Ernst then dropped this bombshell, signaling that many Republicans aren t happy with how Trump is performing: I have not spoken to him about the Florida issue yet, but that is something I think that has been bothering not just me, but some other members of our caucus. So I think that is going to be a topic of discussion that we have when we get back to Washington. Ernst has criticized Trump before, previously stating that he  has a number of flaws.  While we can t expect that the GOP will lash out at Trump for taking far more golf trips than former President Barack Obama did, this is a step in the right direction. It seems the GOP is trying to reel Trump in and actually get him to perform his presidential duties. They probably won t succeed, but their attempts show that Trump s honeymoon period is coming to an end as he has nothing to show for his first 100 days in office.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"April 19, 2017"
 YOU’RE FIRED: Fox News Is Finally Kicking Trump Pal Bill O’Reilly To The Curb And It’s About Damn Time,"For decades, Bill O Reilly has poisoned the airwaves with his racism, sexism, and right-wing rhetoric on Fox News. Not anymore.The exodus of advertisers from his show on the conservative propaganda network finally tipped the scales against O Reilly. Years of sexually harassing his female colleagues, being a domestic abuser, and lying about being a war correspondent were apparently not enough to justify firing him earlier, but lost advertiser dollars struck the killing blow on O Reilly s pathetic career.New York Magazine reports:According to sources briefed on the discussions, network executives are preparing to announce O Reilly s departure before he returns from an Italian vacation on April 24. Now the big questions are how the exit will look and who will replace him.O Reilly went on  vacation  after the New York Times revealed that Fox News has spent $13 million settling sexual harassment lawsuits against O Reilly over the years.In response to the revelation, O Reilly played the victim. The worst part of my job is being a target for those who would harm me and my employer, the Fox News Channel,  O Reilly said.But the fact that Fox News paid off O Reilly s many accusers rather than fight them in court makes it pretty clear that Fox knew they would not win.Once the New York Times story got out, companies who advertise on O Reilly s show began pulling their ads in droves. The allegations are disturbing and, given the importance of women in every aspect of our business, we don t feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now,  Mercedes-Benz said in a statement.And that s pretty much the stance every other company has taken to explain why they are pulling their advertising.Of course, O Reilly had his defenders as well.Serial sexual predator Donald Trump, who admitted he grabs women by their genitals without their consent, defended him. I don t think Bill did anything wrong,  Trump said.  I think he s a person I know well   he is a good person. Trump s decision to weigh in didn t help O Reilly at all. A majority of women in this country fiercely oppose him, and Trump s past statements about women and his past treatment of women was just another example of a sexual predator defending a fellow sexual predator.Fox News is expected to publicly announce O Reilly s departure soon. But they won t say he was fired. They ll make up some bullshit about how this was a mutual decision and they ll say nothing but good things about O Reilly. O Reilly will likely whine and claim that he s the real victim.But the impact of O Reilly s firing will last for years. Conservatives love his show and he was a ratings winner for a network that has started to struggle.Megyn Kelly s departure from the network was a major blow. Losing O Reilly as well will be crushing. Ratings have already dipped and Fox News  audience is aging.Fox News and conservatives are going to miss O Reilly. The majority of the country, however, are going to say  good riddance.

 Sarah Palin Gets Annihilated On Twitter For Whining About Elizabeth Warren Using ‘Fight Like A Girl’ Line,"At least Elizabeth Warren isn t a quitter like Sarah Palin.After all, Sarah Palin could have remained in office as Governor of Alaska and continued to build a political career. Instead, Palin quit halfway through her term to pursue reality stardom and has become nothing more than a desperate grifter who relies on donations to her super PAC to maintain her lifestyle.That s not  fighting like a girl,  it s conning like a conman.Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, however, is still fighting for women and the poor and middle class in Congress and could very well run for president in 2020. Warren has been fighting for the American people for years and has become a symbol of the women s movement.That s why Warren posed with the  Fearless Girl  statue on Tuesday and posted the image on Twitter with the caption,  Fight like a girl. Fight like a girl. pic.twitter.com/qGTn46jS9W  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 18, 2017And of course, Sarah Palin whined about it by crying to Breitbart.Palin claimed that she s a  legit fighter  for women and accused Warren of urging women to  claim victimization  when asked about her use of the phrase. I don t know. Coming from liberals who urge women to claim victimization,  Fight like a girl  just doesn t sound the same as when legit fighters for equality say it, mean it, live it, and will never give it up. Basically, Palin thinks fighting like a girl means never speaking up when you re being treated like shit.Women in this country have had to deal with rape culture, discrimination, and pay inequality for far too long, not to mention all the attacks on reproductive rights coming from right-wingers like Palin herself.How can one claim to  fight like a girl  when one doesn t even bother to fight for women rights to make their own choices about their own bodies?As usual, Palin is nothing more than a complete hypocrite who is bitching about a phrase she has never lived up to.Even Twitter users slammed Palin for attacking Warren.@SarahPalinUSA Sorry Sara but you didn t create the quote , you stole it and claimed it as yours #GovernorQuitter  Joey Mitchell (@JoeyM728) April 19, 2017@SarahPalinUSA Before you know it, she ll be hanging out in Alaska claiming that she can see Russia from her backyard.

 BREAKING: Benghazi-Obsessed GOP Congressman Jason Chaffetz Too Scared To Run For Re-election (DETAILS),"Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has been a thorn in the side of Democrats ever since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. He blamed her for many things that clearly were beyond her control, most notably the attacks on the compound in Benghazi, Libya, that wound up taking the lives of multiple America diplomats. After that attack, Chaffetz, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, spent more than two years and millions in taxpayer money to keep investigating Hillary   each time coming up empty because she did nothing wrong. He even said he had investigations lined up in the event that Hillary took the White House. Well, now that Trump is president and there are no more Clinton investigations to keep his base salivating, Chaffetz has announced that there will be no 2018 Congressional race for him.Chaffetz took to Facebook Wednesday morning to announce his decision, and, of course, he insists that it was not a politically motivated move: After long consultation with my family and prayerful consideration, I have decided I will not be a candidate for any office in 2018. For those that would speculate otherwise, let me be clear that I have no ulterior motives. I am healthy. I am confident I would continue to be re-elected by large margins. I have the full support of Speaker Ryan to continue as Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. That said, I have made a personal decision to return to the private sector. Here is the embed of the full Facebook post:Despite what Chaffetz is saying regarding his reasons for not running again, it s likely a pack of lies. After all, he made it his mission to destroy Hillary Clinton, and made it clear that he would continue to try and get her on something, anything were she to be elected president. However, now that we have Trump as president instead of Hillary, Chaffetz is choosing to turn a blind eye to all of Trump s scandals. He refuses to look into Trump s conflicts of interest, is mum on the Russia investigation for the most part, and has nothing to say on Trump s lies and obvious character flaws and deficiencies. In short   as long as the president is a Republican, he can trample the law into pieces all he wants.This stance would have likely been problematic for Chaffetz in the 2018 Congressional race, to say the least. His state largely loathed Trump, and the alternative conservative candidate and #NeverTrump media star Evan McMullin got a good chunk of the vote. In short   Chaffetz would have been primaried, and would have likely suffered a crushing defeat there. Instead of risking that, he is choosing to bow out early, and use lame excuses to do so.All I can say is good riddance, you nasty little tool. We won t be missing you.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 19, 2017"
" Pence On Aircraft Carrier Lie: No, It Wasn’t Strategy, We’re Just Morons","The White House led people to believe that a U.S. aircraft carrier was on his way to the waters off the Korean peninsula in a show of military strength. White House press secretary said,  I think when you see a carrier group steaming into an area like that, the forward presence of that is clearly, through almost every instance, a huge deterrence,  he said, adding that it  gives the President options in the region.  However, none of that is true because the U.S. aircraft carrier was traveling in the opposite direction.According to vice-president Mike Pence, the claims of the location of the U.S. aircraft carrier supposedly on its way off the Korean peninsula were not made intentionally. Or in reality, he s saying the White House doesn t know how to communicate because it s so inept, or perhaps, Trump used this to bolster his alleged presidency so that his first 100 days in office won t appear to be a complete disaster.Politico reports:Earlier this month, White House and Pentagon officials announced that the USS Carl Vinson and its accompanying battle group had been deployed off the coast of the Korean peninsula, a response to a missile test launched by North Korea. But on Monday, Defense News reported that the Carl Vinson was nowhere near the Korean peninsula and had instead been photographed near Indonesia.After reports from major outlets saying that the Carl Vinson had not immediately turned north towards the Korean peninsula, government officials were left having to explain why the aircraft carrier had not been deployed as initially described.Pence was asked during an interview with CNN if the remarks from White House and Pentagon officials had been intentional and the vice-president said,  oh, I think not  then went on to say there was already a strong U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, including in Japan and South Korea. Pence did not explain why government officials declared that the that the strike group was  steaming up toward the sea of Japan. Here is Sean Spicer saying exactly that on Monday:CNN interviewed Pence aboard the USS Ronald Reagan at the U.S. Yokosuka naval base in Tokyo Bay and addressed the crew saying that the U.S. would  work diligently  with allies to maintain and increase pressure on North Korea. The United States of America will always seek peace but under President Trump, the shield stands guard and the sword stands ready,  Pence said.  Those who would challenge our resolve or readiness should know, we will defeat any attack and meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response. The word  effective  doesn t mean what Pence thinks it means.Just one week after the announcement that the carrier was off the Korean peninsula, an official Navy photo showed that the strike group was actually farther away from the claimed location than it had been at the time of the announcement.Photo by Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images.",News,"April 19, 2017"
 BREAKING: Explosive Russian Dossier Deemed Reliable Enough For FBI To Obtain FISA Warrant,"Remember that explosive Russian dossier from a few months that revealed Donald Trump s collusion with Moscow and affinity for pee pee parties? At the time, the document (supposedly written by a British spy) was considered too questionable to be believed. But now, it appears that at the dossier may be more legitimate than originally thought.CNN reported on Tuesday that the FBI deemed the Russian dossier reliable enough to obtain a FISA warrant against Trump aide, Carter Page. Sources added that FBI Director James Comey had also used the document  to bolster [the FBI s] investigation  during his testimony to Congress.According to CNN,  the dossier alleges that Page met senior Russian officials as an emissary of the Trump campaign, and discussed quid-pro-quo deals relating to sanctions, business opportunities and Russia s interference in the election. CNN REPORTING JUST NOW: FBI used dossier of alleged Russian ties to Trump s campaign as part of the justification to get FISA approval. /1  Marshall Cohen (@Marshall_Cohen) April 18, 2017The FISA was to monitor the communications of Carter Page, who was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign at the time. /2  Marshall Cohen (@Marshall_Cohen) April 18, 2017Page s trip to Russia in July 2016 drew the FBI s attention and raised concerns of his contacts with suspected Russian operatives. /3  Marshall Cohen (@Marshall_Cohen) April 18, 2017Page tells CNN he will sue Obama admin. officials for  civil rights violations.

Even though FBI has distanced itself from the dossier lately. /5  Marshall Cohen (@Marshall_Cohen) April 18, 2017As CNN points out, the fact that the FBI used the dossier to obtain a FISA warrant means that they believe at least parts of it are true.  Officials familiar with the process say even if the application to monitor Page included information from the dossier, it would only be after the FBI had corroborated the information through its own investigation,  noted the network.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2017"
" Fox Host LOSES IT, Expertly Rips Trump’s ‘Buy American’ Policy APART (VIDEO)","While most of America can see right through to the flaws of Donald Trump s policies, it s always a special moment when someone from Fox News recognizes it.Earlier today, Fox host Shep Smith tore Trump s latest executive order apart, noting that it could actually ruin America s economy instead of help it. Smith, who has been a vocal critic on Trump before, expertly pointed out that Trump s announcement of a  Buy American and Hire American  order will actually cause the cost of goods in America to skyrocket.Trump s new plan will review the H-1B visa program for foreign workers; a program that many massive companies use. Pointing out that the program serves a purpose, Smith explained: Tech giants including Amazon, Apple, Google, and others all hire thousands and thousand of using it. Even automakers, including Ford and GM, use this program to find engineers. Executives for those companies argue they can t always find enough American workers with the skills needed for the specific jobs. They also claim the program encourages students to stay in the United States after school. Then, Smith went after Trump by pointing out that even the POTUS himself doesn t buy or hire American when it comes to his own businesses: But the White House says the companies take advantage of those visas, that they bring in large numbers of foreign workers pay them less, and drive down wages. President Trump himself has gone back and forth over this program. And as for the president s push to  buy American,  opponents point out the obvious, that some of the president s own products were made from workers from about a dozen other companies. And besides  the price of everything at your Walmart and your local store and everywhere else goes way up for you. Smith is exactly right and brilliant for exposing Trump s own hypocrisy, and for explaining to conservatives that the man they elected is not going to help America like they thought he would.You can watch Smith take down Trump below:Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2017"
 BOMBSHELL: Trump Lied – His ‘Armada’ Was NOT Headed Toward North Korea At All,"Last week, Trump was bellowing up one side and down the other about a possible nuclear test that North Korea was set to conduct over the weekend. He claimed we might launch a pre-emptive strike against them, and that we had two ships in the region already From an NBC News story dated April 13: The intelligence officials told NBC News that the U.S. has positioned two destroyers capable of shooting Tomahawk cruise missiles in the region, one just 300 miles from the North Korean nuclear test site and earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group was being diverted to the area.  [emphasis mine]Turns out, that wasn t true.The  armada  Trump was speaking of was, at the time, headed the opposite way toward Australia, and had not been turned around. It wasn t until the Navy posted a photo of the Carl Vinson and its strike group in the sea between the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra that the story came out. The photo was taken on Saturday, Apr. 15, a few days after we heard that the Carl Vinson had been diverted and was heading toward the Sea of Japan.Now it s headed that way and should arrive sometime next week. Two weeks after we told the world it was already heading there.So what happened?The White House says they were going off of what the Defense Department said. The Defense Department said there was a  glitch-ridden sequence of events,  including a premature announcement courtesy of the Pacific Command, and a false explanation from Defense Secretary James Mattis.All of that, they say, contributed to the false narrative that we had an armada speeding towards North Korea in a grandiose show of force.Really? That makes all the sense in the world.Truthfully, officials don t understand why the Defense Department didn t issue a correction on its timeline of events regarding the movements of those ships. With Spicer and others actually answering questions about it, and the extreme tension of the situation, one would think they d be as careful as possible about this.Instead, it sounds like the White House is putting all the blame for this clusterfuck onto the Pentagon, which is par for the course when they re either caught in a lie or something goes massively wrong.Of course, some Trumpkins will believe that Trump was deliberately misleading all of Asia (sending them into a panic), as well as Russia and us, to trick North Korea into trying something or to surprise them later on. No doubt someone will say that s brilliant.And anyone who does say that s brilliant (up to and including Trump himself, which isn t far-fetched at all) has no idea what the consequences of that kind of a bluff could be. Regardless, we caused a panic both here and among our allies that didn t need to happen, and risked a war over something very false.The Trump administration had better get its act together where hostile foreign powers are concerned.Featured image by Ron Sachs   Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2017"
 Man Dies In Peace After Learning Trump Had Been ‘Impeached’,"A dying man had just one wish, and that was for Donald Trump to be impeached. Unfortunately, Michael Garland Elliott died before impeachment even began (if it will ever begin), but he died in peace on April 6th, after his family lied to him.Elliott was divorced, but his ex-wife was still his best friend.Teresa Elliot, the man s  ex-wife and best friend,  wanted to give him comfort in his final moments.  Upon hearing that, he took his final, gentle breath [and] his early work concluded,  the obituary in the Oregonian reads.Source: SalonHere is the full obituary: Michael Garland Elliott passed away peacefully, April 6, 2017, surrounded by people who loved him dearly and cared for him selflessly during the last months of his life. He was born in Charlottesville, Va., in either 1940 or 1941 (he honestly didn t know!), and attended Lane High School, where he shined on the basketball court. After college at University of Virginia, he moved to Long Beach, Calif., where, among other things, he joined a semi-pro basketball team that toured the country playing exhibition games, dressed as women. At such times Mike was called Skaggy Maggie and continued round-ball domination, albeit with a different uniform.Mike was a Porsche enthusiast, owning a dozen of them over the years, but nothing touched his heart like  the ancient game,  golf. He was a founding member of The Reserve and spent countless weekends doing what he loved most with like-minded friends. He was very passionate about the game. One time (that we know of) he was angered by an errant shot and threw his club into a tree. Eventually every club in his bag was in that tree. Mike s health had declined over the past decade, and when he was no longer able to golf he accepted it with grace and humor, and threw things at the TV instead. Mike was also the sharpest dresser in town, single-handedly keeping Nike s apparel wing in the black.Though Mike had no family remaining, he stayed close to the people he d worked with in the plastics industry, especially Danny Velansky and Sean O Brian, who was by his side at the end. Also present were Larry Smith, Judy Wiley, lovely neighbors Russ, Sandy and Garrett, and his devoted caregivers Alisha Alex, Sara Young and Leslie Kampmann, angels in human form. No patient ever, ever had more loving care.Mike ran out of family long ago and is survived by his ex-wife and best friend, Teresa Elliott. Though their marriage ran aground, their friendship only grew stronger and hers was the last voice Mike heard. And the last thing she said to him was  Donald Trump has been impeached.  Upon hearing that he took his final, gentle breath, his earthly work concluded. Mike will be forever missed but never forgotten. There s a metaphor here (we re talking to you, Calexit people). Elliott appears to know that strength is in numbers. The #resistance can win, but only if we remain strong.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images. ",News,"April 18, 2017"

 WATCH: Donald Trump Doesn’t Seem To Know Who The Leader Of North Korea Is,"During an interview on Fox  News,  alleged president Donald Trump referred to North Korea s current leader Kim Jong-un as  that gentleman  while never saying his name. This didn t happen just once, but twice. I don t want to telegraph what I m doing or what I m thinking,  Trump told Fox News  Ainsley Earhardt.  I m not like other administrations where they say,  We re going to do this in four weeks.  It doesn t work that way. We ll see what happens. I hope things work out well. I hope there s going to be peace. Things even got weirder when Trump said,  You know, they ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time. You read Clinton s book, he said,  Oh, we made such a great peace deal,  and it was a joke. You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody has been outplayed, they ve all been outplayed by this gentleman. And we ll see what happens. But I just don t telegraph my moves. However, Kim Jong-un assumed control of the country following his father s death in 2011 so we re not sure how Bill Clinton was outplayed by the 33-year-old dictator.  This gentleman  Trump was referring to was Kim Jong-il. They are two different people. And for the record, we ve had peace since the Korean war, so those deals were successful in maintaining peace   unlike the posturing Trump is doing, which is escalating tension to a level that has never been seen before.As reporter Ana Marie Cox from MTV News pointed out in a tweet, Trump doesn t know who is in power in North Korea.Guys.

Guys, this is totally not scary at all. Trump is making war noises at a dictator who has been dead for years and the former reality show star thinks the former North Korean leader is alive and well.

 CORRUPTION: Ivanka Trump Gets Trademarks From China After Meeting With Chinese President At Mar-a-Lago,"This is a major ethics violation. Period.In March, Donald Trump made his daughter Ivanka an official part of his administration by giving her an office in the White House. My biggest concern is that this is yet another erosion of government ethics standards in this White House,  said government ethics expert and law professor Kathleen Clark at the time.And now those concerns are being raised again.Supposedly, Ivanka won t be paid a salary. But it appears that Ivanka is being compensated in other ways.Not long after getting her own White House position, Ivanka joined her father at Mar-a-Lago to dine with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife.Ivanka even posted a picture of herself with Jinping at Mar-a-Lago on Twitter thanking him for visiting the United States.Thank you President Xi Jinping and Madame Peng Liyuan for your visit to the United States ?? pic.twitter.com/VLvzyDMiiY  Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) April 9, 2017But what Ivanka was apparently really thanking Jinping for was the trademarks China awarded to her company on the same day they had dinner together.According to The Boston Globe,On April 6, Ivanka Trump s company won provisional approval from the Chinese government for three new trademarks, giving it monopoly rights to sell Ivanka brand jewelry, bags and spa services in the world s second-largest economy. That night, the first daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner, sat next to the president of China and his wife for a steak and Dover sole dinner at Mar-a-Lago.Clearly, Ivanka Trump and her dad are still using the White House to get lucrative business deals and now that Ivanka works directly in the White House, she ll have even more access to foreign leaders to benefit her business and fill her family s pockets.Ivanka previously joined her father in a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the same time that a licensing agreement between her company and Sanei International was at stake.So Ivanka Trump can t pretend that she s involved in her dad s administration because she gives a damn about helping people and serving her country. She only cares about herself and has demonstrated repeatedly that she doesn t care about ethics as long as she s making money. This entire administration is corrupt to the core and it s time for Trump and his family to be kicked out of the White House before they sell America to the highest bidder to enrich themselves.Featured Image: Twitter",News,"April 18, 2017"
 Trump Just Shamed Our Country Yet AGAIN With His Latest Diplomacy Disaster (DETAILS),"Donald Trump has made a fine art of p*ssing off other world leaders. Thanks to our fearless orange tweeter-in-chief, Colombia s government is now furious with us too.According to Colombia Reports, Donald Trump met with Former President Andres Pastrana (1998-2002) and former President Alvaro Uribe (2002-2010), an opposition leader, at Mar-a-Lago. Current Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, who has not yet gotten to meet with Trump himself, is not impressed.Santos has spoken to Trump to express his concern that Uribe s lobbying in the U.S. is a major inconvenience for the government of Colombia. But the only response he has gotten from the White House is that Trump will take care of it personally. Vice-President Oscar Naranjo said Uribe and Pastrana have overstepped by pushing their own political interests rather than those defined by the official government. Presidents and their foreign ministers are those who really establish and maintain these relations  with foreign governments, Naranjo explained.Uribe and Pastrana have both made it abundantly clear that they are opposed to the peace process and they are kissing up to Trump because the U.S. is the only country that has not yet promised to offer financial aid.Colombia Reports writes:Only last week, senators of Uribe s hard-right Democratic Center party wrote a letter in which they asked the US to not financially support the peace process.On Sunday Uribe published a letter to US Congress on Twitter, warning that the efforts to end 52 years of political violence could lead to Colombia becoming an authoritarian communist state similar to Venezuela.Additionally, the former head of state claimed that the transitional justice court that could try him for a number of war crimes is being set up by communist sympathizers.Juan Carlos Pinzon, Colombia s ambassador in Washington, said that Uribe and Pastrana made their meeting with Trump sound much more important than it actually was. There was an encounter, not a meeting or a formal date,  Pinzon said.So, it seems we can now add Colombia to the list of countries that Trump has offended by being a moron without the slightest understanding of foreign policy.

 Trump Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch Gets HUMILIATED On First Day By Another Judge,"Welcome to the big leagues, kid.Donald Trump s Supreme Court Justice only made it through Senate confirmation because Republicans changed the rules so they could complete their robbery of the seat from President Obama pick Merrick Garland.Neil Gorsuch now sits on the high court and his first day was Monday. And of course, just like Trump, he embarrassed himself from the get-go.Gorsuch s first case involved a Census Bureau worker who had been dismissed and filed a lawsuit over it.The former government employee s lawyers want the entire case to be allowed to move forward instead of only part of it being heard by the federal appeals courts. Rather than keep his mouth shut and learn, Gorsuch apparently decided to try to prove that he belonged there.And he didn t waste time. Gorsuch was argumentative and spent lots of time on wording. In other words, it looks like Gorsuch is going to be an asshole judge who is going to base every decision he makes on exact wording and his interpretation of those words. He s going to nitpick and decide cases on technicalities.But then Gorsuch decided to go even further by changing the decorum of the court. Channeling Trump, Gorsuch literally accused attorney Chris Landau of lying in open court.According to Bloomberg,Landau asked the court to let the man s entire suit go forward in a federal district court, rather than waiting for part of the case to be addressed first by a federal appeals court. When Landau said he wasn t asking the court to  break any new ground,  Gorsuch gave a pointed response. No, just to continue to make it up,  Gorsuch said.But Landau is correct. As Bloomberg points out, there is plenty of precedent of the Supreme Court allowing such lawsuits to move forward in their entirety. So Landau really isn t asking the high court to do anything different than it has before. He s asking them to uphold precedent, something Gorsuch clearly has no interest in doing regardless of what the law says.But Justice Elena Kagan was quick to put Gorsuch in his place and humiliated him in the process. This would be kind of a revolution,  she began.  I mean, to the extent you can have a revolution in this kind of case. The room laughed as everyone recognized a good Supreme Court burn.So just like Donald Trump, Gorsuch is an embarrassment.Frankly, not only should Trump be impeached, Gorsuch should be impeached as well. He doesn t belong in the position he currently holds. It s clear he has no respect for Supreme Court decorum and that he will make partisan decisions regardless of precedent and the law. And Republicans are the ones to blame for this. They chose Trump to be their leader and they forced Gorsuch upon the Supreme Court. It s up to Democrats to fix both of these embarrassments as soon as they take back control of Congress.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2017"
 BRUTAL New Poll Shows Stunning Drop In Trump’s Numbers In Six Key Areas; Trump HUMILIATED,"Trump is not keeping his promises. As far as his supporters were concerned, he started off okay, but over the last few weeks he s done a stunning array of flip-flops, and people apparently are not happy about it. In February, Gallup conducted a poll of people who believed Trump would keep his promises, and at that time, a majority of American (62 percent) believed he would. Now that has flip-flopped, and today, only 45 percent believe he ll keep his promises.So what all has he flipped on?And there s probably a lot more. In short, he s proven that he s not the open, honest, and trustworthy man he claimed to be on the campaign trail, and people are finally starting to wake up to that. Too little, too late, though, since he s already in office.But wait! There s more. Only 52 percent of Americans believe Trump is a strong and decisive leader, down from 59 percent in February. 46 percent believe he can bring about the changes we need here, down from 53 percent. 36 percent see him as honest and trustworthy, down from 42 percent. 42 percent believe he cares about their needs, down from 46 percent, and 41 percent believe he can effectively manage the government, down from 44 percent.In other words, fewer people trust Trump to pretty much do anything now than they did a mere two months ago. As Trump approaches his first 100-day mark, that s a humiliating picture.Featured image by Ron Sachs-Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2017"
 Neo-Nazi Sues Trump For Making Him Punch A Black Lady At A Rally (VIDEO),"Apparently, if you are unqualified enough for a job, you will develop mind control powers   at least, that s what neo-Nazi Matthew Heimbach thinks.  During his campaign, Donald Trump regularly encouraged his supporters to beat up African-Americans in the crowd, even offering to pay their legal fees if they did as he told them to (a promise that, like most of his promises, has yet to manifest).In March Heimbach, leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Youth Network and a loyal Donald Trump soldier took it to heart when The Donald screamed  Get  em out of here  as African-American protesters attempted to inform him and his supporters that their lives have just as much value as white lives (and infinitely more value than those of the crackers who would vote for the ideological reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, though protesters generally leave that detail out). Heimbach, wearing his MAGAMAGAMAGA hat, can be seen in a video captured at the time shoving and punching an African-American woman as Trump sicced his posse on her.Kashiya Nwanguma, the woman from the video and other protesters who were attacked recently filed suit against Heimbach, two other Trump supporters, and the Trump campaign   and Heimbach, who is representing himself, responded with a countersuit not against the women but against the man for whom he voted.Heimbach claims he acted  pursuant to the directives and requests of Donald J. Trump and Donald J. Trump for President  and that if he s found liable for damages,   any liability must be shifted to one or both of them. In other words, he knows he s fucked and hoping the  I was just following orders  defense works out for him even if he does have to throw Trump under the bus. Heimbach says he denies physically assaulting  protesters, adding that they  provoked a response  by attempting to  disrupt a free assembly and campaign event and to infringe rights of the defendants and other attendees to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom to vote and other constitutional rights. One again, he can be seen on video attacking Nwanguma. Since he will almost assuredly be using Google a lot in preparing his defense, he should probably look up  perjury  while he is at it. Mr. Nazi adds that he acted, if at all, in self defense  as well as  in reasonable defense of others    even when he was shoving his victim from behind.Heimbach says that The Donald is a  world famous businessman  who relies on various professionals including attorneys and other professional advisors,  so he relied on Trump s reputation and expertise in doing the things alleged.  This accidental admission of fault will, of course, come back to bite him in his posterior.This filing comes alongside one filed by one of the other attackers, Alvin Bamberger, who also attacked Nwanguma. Bamberger says that he   had no prior intention to act as he did  and  would not have acted as he did without Trump and/or the Trump Campaign s specific urging and inspiration.  He  admits only that he touched a woman  and, like Mr. Nazi, denies that he assaulted that woman    video be damned!Speaking of video, you can watch it below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 18, 2017"
 Two GOPers Left Looking Like Gooey Piles Of Stupid In Front Of Constituents At Town Hall (VIDEO),"Republicans who backed Donald Trump because he was the GOP nominee while knowing full well that he was incompetent now have to face the wrath of their constituents. The former reality show star is not draining the swamp; he s filling it to the brim with terrifying creatures. He s not the transparent president he promised he would be. He s up to his eyeballs in scandals, one of which involves a foreign hostile government interfering with our presidential election process. The alleged president is also refusing to release his tax returns. Mexico is not paying for the wall. We, the taxpayers, will foot the bill for his ego-wall.U.S. Rep. French Hill and Sen. Tom Cotton held a town hall and had to face an unwelcoming crowd. The two Republicans were left stammering while trying to find answers for Trump s actions.Hill and Cotton look like they have on matching outfits.

Arkansas constituents told Hill to do his job as he stood there with a look of frustration on his face.

 Trump Just Called A Fledgling Dictator To Congratulate Him On Expanding His Powers,"It takes one to know one. Turkey just held a referendum that greatly expands the power of their president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It passed by a very narrow margin, taking Turkey on its latest step toward brutal dictatorship, and here s Donald Trump, who sources say called Erdogan to congratulate him on  winning  the referendum vote.While we re busy justifying blowing up absolutely nothing in Syria because a brutal dictator used sarin gas on his people, Trump is busy calling someone who s working hard on becoming the region s next brutal dictator to congratulate him on furthering that goal.This referendum, according to The Daily Beast, moves Turkey away from a parliamentary democracy and towards one-person rule. But what he has already done there makes the referendum more of a formality. Erdogan had already managed to form a one-party government   a move that greatly diminishes the voices of opposition.Last year, Erdogan asked Turkey s parliament to redefine the country s anti-extremism law to include politicians, journalists and members of academia. He claimed that  pro-Kurdish  politicians were inciting terrorism, and journalists and academics were spreading the info that allowed the politicians to do so. Therefore, they are all terrorists.Branding press as  the enemy  is something Trump has been trying to do here. As the Washington Post s front page motto says,  Democracy dies in darkness.  This is the darkness.And now, Erdogan is, more or less, the sole ruler of Turkey.But what does Trump care? It wouldn t be surprising to find that he wishes something like that would happen here, too, if for no other reason than it would help cement his overinflated opinion of himself as a great man who is beloved by all, with nobody left to shine a light on the truth, like, oh, say, a free press.The way the Turkey referendum was held has appalled international election monitors. According to them,  voters were not provided with adequate information, opposition voices were muzzled and the rules were changed at the last minute.  In short, this was not a truly democratic process.Good job continuing to support authoritarian rulers over true democracies, Trump. You re about as un-American as it gets.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"April 17, 2017"
" This Congressman Has Literally Created BRUTAL ‘Illegitimacy Clock’ For Trump, And It’s Magnificent","If you thought no one in Washington D.C. was feeling the same way about Donald Trump as you are, think again. Several people within the halls of Congress think he s as illegitimate as you do.In fact, one Congressman, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) has gone so far as to create a  Cloud of Illegitimacy Clock  in honor of Trump.If you visit Lieu s Media Center portion of his official Congressional website, this is what you ll see:lieu.house.govHere s Lieu s statement regarding Trump s violation of Article 1, Section 9 of the United States Constitution: The second after Donald Trump took the oath of office, he violated the Constitution and continues to do so. The Framers wrote Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution to prevent foreign influence over our elected officials. It mandates that no person holding office  shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever from any King, Prince, or foreign State.  While holding office, Mr. Trump will receive by virtue of his continued interest in the vast and global Trump Organization and his stake in hundreds of other entities a steady stream of monetary and other benefits from foreign powers and their agents. This is illegal.Trump can stop his illegal behavior by divesting his global business interests or putting them into blind trusts. He refuses to do so. Not only is he violating the law, he is explicitly putting his financial interests and those of his family above the interests of America. Trump is not making America First, he is making America Second.As a Member of the House Judiciary Committee, I will do everything I can to hold Trump accountable. My first action is the creation of a Cloud of Illegitimacy Clock that keeps track of the seconds, minutes, hours, and days that Trump is operating outside of the law. At some point, the Clock is going to catch up to Trump. For now, Trump appears to be taking the position of former President Richard Nixon that  when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.  How did that work out? What Trump is doing is illegal and action must be taken to stop it. Either he needs to cut all financial ties completely or he should be forced to resign or impeached and brought to justice as the crook that he so apparently seems to be.Good on Rep. Lieu for taking the first steps in holding Trump accountable. You can t do anything without calling him out on his illegal activity first. Well done.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 17, 2017"
" Mike Pence Just Dropped A TERRIFYING Bombshell On North Korea, Threatens War (VIDEO)","On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence traveled to the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea to do Trump s dirty work and deliver a message that should make every American extremely uncomfortable.In an interview with CNN s Dana Bash, Pence confirmed that the Trump administration was throwing diplomacy out the window and abandoning  the failed policy of strategic patience.  Pence said: We re going to abandon the failed policy of strategic patience. But we re going to redouble our efforts to bring diplomatic and economic pressure to bear on North Korea. Our hope is that we can resolve this issue peaceably. [Strategic patience] was the policy of the United States of America during prior administrations to practice what they called strategic patience, that was to hope to martial international support to bring an end to the nuclear ambitions and the ballistic missile program of North Korea. that clearly ahs failed and the advent of nuclear weapons testing and development of a nuclear program all confirms the fact that strategic patience has failed. When Bash asked Pence to clarify what he meant, Pence said: We re going to abandon the failed policy of strategic patience but we re going to redouble our efforts to bring diplomatic and economic pressure to bear on North Korea. Our hope is that we can resolve this situation peaceably. And I know the President was heartened by his discussions with President Xi (Jinping). We ve seen China begin to take some actions to bring pressure on North Korea but there needs to be more. Resolving this issue requires all relevant parties, especially parties that bear major responsibility and play a key role in this issue, to work in the same direction and make a joint effort. You can watch Pence deliver this message below:.@VP Pence warns North Korea not to test President Trump s resolve in exclusive CNN interview at the DMZ https://t.co/qb7kjI3sPK  New Day (@NewDay) April 17, 2017While Pence might have tried to soften his message while he was speaking to Bash, he said this to acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo-ahn on Monday, making more of a direct threat: Just in the past two weeks, the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan.North Korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region. Clearly, Trump wants to take more of a strong-arm approach and is using Pence to deliver this terrifying message. As North Korea has already launched a (failed) missile and Trump has proven himself to be trigger-happy when it comes to dropping bombs and his own missile attacks, this abandonment of diplomacy could very well mean war in the near future.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"April 17, 2017"
 Trump Influence CRUMBLING As His Own Supporters Share SHOCKING Resentment For Him (DETAILS),"The majority of America saw this coming: Trump s supporters are finally becoming extremely disappointed in the failing performance of their president of choice.Thanks to a New York Times profile of Trump supporters in Pennsylvania, we now know that Trump voters recognize that they re not seeing any of the  winning  that Trump has promised them over and over. Things have gotten so bad, that the only people in Trump s corner are actually losing hope.Theresa Remington, a home-care worker with two children on active duty in the Marines, had hopes Trump would be good for the Veterans Administration and health care system   and has been severely disappointed. Remington said Trump was Just like any other damn president,  and now she s curious about what things would have been like if Sen. Bernie Sanders had won the election.Brian Mock, a tattoo artist, admitted with reluctance that Trump is not the right president for this country. Mock said: No one wants to be wrong. It s seeing a house on fire and saying,  That house isn t on fire.  It is very clearly on fire. According to The Times, Trump supporters feel they have been blindsided and are wondering where Trump s grandiose promises have gone. Some have been completely turned off by Trump s erratic tweeting. Some are so upset with Trump that they feel more confident that Vice President Mike Pence would be a more capable POTUS.Bill Yokobosky IV, a train engineer, admitted: It s not what he s done, it s what he s trying to do. He hasn t succeeded, really. He s fighting himself and he s fighting Washington. They re just trying to get settled in there. The Times  report of the defeat Trump supporters are feeling is right in line with Trump s approval rating, which is now lower than ever before according to a recent Gallup poll.

 Trump Finally Found A Book He Can ‘Read’ And The Internet Can’t Stop Laughing At Him,"As we all know, Donald Trump does not like to read books. Hell, he really doesn t read anything at all unless it s something that strokes his ego. But he finally found the perfect book and he humiliated himself by telling the world about it.In a morning Twitter rant on Monday, Trump promoted a book that is literally filled with mostly blank pages.

 Melania Has To Remind Trump How To Do National Anthem In Most Pathetic Moment Of WH Easter (VIDEO),"Trump s hastily organized White House Easter Egg Roll went from bad to worse after he almost managed to botch the national anthem on camera.After avoiding the children s event on the White House lawn for several hours so he could finish watching Fox and Friends (yes, really), Trump revealed that he wasn t prepared to handle even the basic responsibilities he was given for the event. In contrast to former President Obama, Trump declined to read to the children, so Melania had to instead. For some time Trump lingered on a railed balcony, separated from the gathered families on the lawn.When it came time to do the National Anthem, Trump seemingly forgot that it is customary to place one s hand over one s heart. While a member of the military band sang, Melania and Barron noticed that the President of the United States was just standing casually with arms at his sides. Melania can be seen nudging Trump s arm, and he finally realizes his mistake.*national anthem begins*Melania & Barron place hands over heart*Melania nudges Trump to do the same**Trump raises hand* pic.twitter.com/X59uYNg7rW  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) April 17, 2017It s possible that Trump s heart wasn t in the event because he had already thrown a private egg roll the night before for dues-paying members of Mar-a-Lago.

 China And Russia Chase US Destroyer Away After Trump’s Navy Creeps Up On North Korea,"Trump s loyalty to Vladimir Putin is being tested like never before. On one hand The Donald really wants a war with North Korea. On the other, both Russia and China have told him to back the f*ck off   and the Associated Press reports that these warnings are becoming more forceful after Trump s Navy sent a Destroyer into the Korean Peninsula:China and Russia have dispatched intelligence-gathering vessels from their navies to chase the USS Carl Vinson nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which is heading toward waters near the Korean Peninsula, multiple sources of the Japanese government revealed to The Yomiuri Shimbun.It appears that both countries aim to probe the movements of the United States, which is showing a stance of not excluding military action against North Korea. The Self-Defense Forces are strengthening warning and surveillance activities in the waters and airspace around the area, according to the sources.China and Russia, which prioritize stability in the Korean Peninsula, showed concern over the tough U.S. stance, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying the issue should be resolved peacefully through political and diplomatic efforts.The dispatch of the intelligence-gathering vessels appears to be partly aimed at sending a warning signal to the United States.Recently, Donald Trump stopped calling China a  currency manipulator  after his companies were granted 38 lucrative trademarks in the country (including for an escort service). As for Russia, we all know what Putin s people did for The Donald.At this point, it is surprising that the United States has any allies left given how Trump has treated them, and countries like Russia and China with whom we enjoy a shaky relationship at best (especially when the former recently committed numerous acts of war against the U.S. during the election), and Trump is testing our bonds with every single friend and frenemy we have.As Trump pushes us toward war with North Korea, he fails to consider that both Russia and China are likely to step in if he goes all Rambo on the tiny island dictatorship.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 17, 2017"
 ‘Lunch Shaming’: Schools Punish Poor Kids Who Can’t Pay For Lunch With Appalling Humiliation (VIDEO),"As we all know, there are many children in America who cannot afford school lunch. Some of these kids are  lucky  (and I use the term loosely) to qualify for free or reduced price school lunches. Others are not. To qualify for these government-sanctioned programs, the children have to be from a family whose income is no more than 30% above the poverty line. That means that a family of four can make no more than $32,000 a year to qualify. Any adult living in America today understands that this is a very difficult   in fact, damn near impossible   amount of money to live on. So, this leads to many children around the country going through the lunch line at school with the inability to pay. However, the tactics used to solve this issue are downright appalling, and they are being deployed all over the nation.A practice referred to as  lunch shaming  is being used to humiliate poor children around the nation for their inability to pay for their lunches. Some kids are stamped in the lunch line with stamps that say things like,  I need lunch money.  Others are forced to clean tables in the cafeteria in front of other students. Still others even have their hot lunches thrown out for their inability to pay.All this serves to do is humiliate already struggling children for things that are far beyond their control. Further, in the cases where the lunches are thrown out, the kids are forced to go hungry. Even worse, some of these kids only get fed at school, so that means that they are literally starving when their one source of food is denied to them.This kind of thing has lifelong effects. Luckily, New Mexico has become the first state to try to put a stop to the practice of lunch shaming. They have introduced legislation that would outlaw the practice, and would make it illegal to engage in any conversations regarding a student s ability to pay for lunch at school with anyone but the student s parents or guardians.The entire nation needs to follow in New Mexico s footsteps. The fact that this sort of thing is happening in the United States of America at all is disgraceful. We should all be ashamed.Watch the video report on this practice below, via AJ+ on Twitter:Children are being shamed for not having lunch money across the U.S. pic.twitter.com/4uSyIJYIGI  AJ+ (@ajplus) April 17, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 17, 2017"
 Trump Asks Advice From The Swamp He Promised To Drain – Americans Are OUTRAGED At What They Said,"Not too long after taking office, Trump decided to start asking around about how the government could roll back regulations and make it easier for companies to get their projects approved. But he didn t ask ordinary Americans, or small business owners. He didn t ask people in small towns and big cities. He asked big corporations what their opinions were. He sought advice from the same people he blasted as  The Swamp  during his campaign, and promised repeatedly to drain it.Now, given who he s appointed to his cabinet, it was pretty clear that he had zero intention of draining the swamp. Trump specifically targeted manufacturers and fossil fuel producers for this, probably because he thinks allowing them to run roughshod will at least help him pretend he s truly bringing manufacturing jobs back. But this is even more egregious because major industry insiders don t care about people. They don t care who they hurt in pursuit of the almighty dollar. Of course they want industry regulations cut   these are the industries people fought (and died) against to stop things like child labor and worker exploitation.The White House got 168 comments total. Manufacturers went after the EPA the hardest, with 79 of those comments targeting that agency. The EPA received 79 comments total, because of course it did. And companies targeted the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts with 48 and 29 comments respectively, because having to clean up after yourself so everyone around you can breathe clean air and drink clean water is just too difficult.Trump s decision to halt key provisions of the Clean Water Act has already angered people, particularly those living in communities that are especially vulnerable to poisoned water. The director of the Sierra Club s  Beyond Coal  campaign has said: Trump s attempt to halt these clean water protections for mercury, lead, and arsenic from coal power plants is dangerous and irresponsible. After years of peer-reviewed studies, extensive input from medical experts and scientists, and thorough review of public comments, the EPA made the right call in finalizing strong clean water protections against coal plants dumping toxic heavy metals into our waterways As a mother, I m frankly horrified that the EPA would put the safety of drinking water at risk for millions of Americans, but that s exactly what they ve done. Coming from West Virginia, where we ve had enormous challenges with maintaining clean water supplies due to the coal industry s political influence, I m outraged that these common sense protections are under attack from the EPA itself. But, well, profit is king here, even though the coal industry is never going to recover no matter what Trump tries to do. A full breakdown of the agencies and regulations that these companies would like to see rolled back, if not outright eliminated, is below:BP says it wants to make it easier to drill for gas and oil in the very same Gulf that was devastated in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, because why force them be careful when they can lie about being able to self-regulate? (Big corporations can t self-regulate.) And The Associated General Contractors of America wants to roll back regulations for paid sick leave for government contractors. They probably want to get rid of overtime rules, too.Of course, business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are applauding Trump for this. They see this administration as one that is finally interested in relieving businesses  from a regulatory onslaught that occurred, principally, during the prior administration. Others are not so sure this is the best way to do things, though, because companies will always, always, always act in their own best interests, and damn the rest of the world. Jeffrey Zients, who worked on regulatory issues under Obama, said: At a time when many CEOS are focused on the short term and looking to maximize their profitability each quarter, I believe that a lot of their aversion to these regulations reflects a short-term mind-set that values reducing costs over anything else.That s unfortunate, because well-crafted regulations are an important part of creating sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run. A detail. These companies don t want sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run. They want unfair and profitable in the short run. It s the nature of the beast.

 WATCH: Army Vet WRECKS Trump – Here’s the REAL Reason He Gave Generals More Control Over Bombing,"Trump was supposed to be a non-interventionist, but, allegedly as soon as he saw videos of poisoned children on cable news (the same children he doesn t want coming here because other videos that were edited showed him that refugees were all big, burly, 20-something men and not mothers and children), he decided we had to intervene in Syria. And he attacked. Then he attacked Afghanistan with the biggest bomb we have.Then he was lauded for both moves, and also lauded for giving more control over this kind of thing to his generals. But Army vet Jason Kander, speaking on CNN s  State of the Union,  has hit the nail on the head for why Trump really gave that control to his generals: I believe he wants to take credit for good things when they happen, and blame generals when bad things happen. Kander also explained that there were only two acceptable answers to why Trump would make such a move: He s the commander-in-chief, and he also needs to defend the reasoning behind why a commander on the ground actually made the decision to bomb Afghanistan with the biggest one we ve got.Had the MOAB failed to do anything at all, Trump would definitely have blamed the general who actually authorized dropping it. Kander backed his position up by explaining how Trump blamed the generals who were in charge of the failed Yemen raid, where we lost Navy SEAL Ryan Owens. Instead of saying,  We lost him,  Trump said,  The generals lost him.  Kander also used Trump s own pseudo-explanation of whether he authorized the MOAB drop to back that truth bomb up: If you think back to when he was asked whether or not he approved the dropping of the MOAB in Afghanistan, his answer was something along the lines of, it started with  Uh,  and then it went from  Uh,  to  Everybody knew exactly what was going on,  which was, of course, the opposite of true. I mean, he was giving that answer because he didn t want people to know exactly whether he approved it or not. Trump won t take responsibility for failures, even military ones.Watch Kander savage Trump over it below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"April 16, 2017"
" White Supremacist Trump Ally Gets Punched While Screaming ‘Clinton Is A Rapist’, Cries Like A Baby (VIDEO)","On some level, it s gratifying that punching Nazis in the face has become a national sport more popular than baseball. On one hand, violence is almost always inexcusable. On the other, they re Nazis. Mike Cernovich, a Donald Trump ally who invented the popular right-wing lie that Hillary Clinton secretly runs a child prostitution operation out of a D.C. pizza shop s basement (the place doesn t even have a basement) showed up at a Tax Day anti-Trump rally and began screaming  Bill Clinton is a rapist  at the top of his lungs like a f*cking moron. Then things got weird(er).Cernovich posted a video in which he claims he was  assaulted by the crowd  who was swarming around him chanting mean things. Cernovich drew attention to himself by calling Bill Clinton a rapist, which of course invited a negative response. At this point, no one touched him but he screamed for police to help him. She s touching me,  Cernovich said before repeating  I m under assault  over and over and over and over. It s really kind of magical in a pathetic sort of way. Man takes the stage at anti-Trump rally, declaring,  Bill Clinton is a rapist!  Crowd rushes man. pic.twitter.com/rIo4gE4RF7  Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) April 15, 2017It s funnier from another point of view:While Cernovich was not attacked in this video, another shows someone walk up and deck him in a perfect example of  be careful what you wish for. .@Rambobiggs Violent leftist caught taking a shot at Cernovich at anti-Trump rally! pic.twitter.com/zxF0XxckuO  Mike Cernovich ?? (@Cernovich) April 15, 2017Cernovich was not injured. In fact, as one of the videos shows, his first concern was posting the video on social media so he could capitalize on this opportunity to play the victim: I was just assaulted, so we need to go live,  Cernovich says as he composes a tweet and runs away to whine to people who think #Pizzagate is a real thing.Recently, Donald Trump Jr. said that Cernovich should receive the Pulitzer for his false report that former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice improperly monitored the Trump campaign.Enjoy the video.

 Donald Trump Says Being President Makes Him Immune To Lawsuits As Supporter Throws Him Under The Bus,"Apparently, Donald Trump wanted to be president because he seriously thinks being president makes him immune to lawsuits. As usual, he s wrong.During his campaign, Trump often urged his supporters to physically assault protesters. And at a rally in Kentucky in March 2016, Trump did exactly that and it caused a black woman to be assaulted as she was forced out of the venue. I was called a n****r and a c*nt and got kicked out,  University of Louisville student Shiya Nwanguma recounted.  They were pushing and shoving at me, cursing at me, yelling at me, called me every name in the book. They re disgusting and dangerous. In fact, the assault was caught on camera and revealed that Alvin Bamberger, Matthew Heimbach, and Joseph Pryor each contributed to the crime.Well, a lawsuit was filed against the men and Donald Trump himself.Of course, attorneys for Trump were quick to try to claim presidential immunity to wriggle out of being held liable for the actions of the three men.They argue that Trump  is immune from suit because he is president of the United States. But that s not true at all and the Supreme Court says so.Back during Bill Clinton s presidency, the high court ruled that a president can be sued for action taken outside of the presidency. And since Trump was not president in March 2016 when he ordered the crowd to  get  em out of here  he can and will face this lawsuit.U.S. District Judge David Hale ruled earlier this month that the evidence indicates that Trump is at least partially responsible for the actions of his supporters at rallies.And even Trump s own supporters are throwing him under the bus.Bamberger, who is a member of a veteran s association, claims his actions were provoked by Trump. Bamberger had no prior intention to act has he did,  his attorneys wrote.  Bamberger would not have acted as he did without Trump and/or Trump campaign s specific urging and inspiration. To the extent that Bamberger acted, he did so in response to   and inspired by   Trump and/or Trump campaign s urging to remove the protesters. Bamberge is literally arguing that if he is found liable in court, so should Trump. And that makes sense. After all, Trump egged his supporters on every time protesters attended his rallies. He even once offered to pay for their defense if they roughed up protesters. So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of him, would you?  he said during a February rally.  Seriously, okay, just knock the hell. I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees; I promise, I promise. From that point forward, violence against protesters by Trump supporters got even worse.So Trump will have to deal with more lawsuits. Because no one, not even the president, is above the law.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 16, 2017"
 Trump Stooge Betsy DeVos Gets Her A** Handed To Her By Joe Biden For Being Soft On College Campus Sexual Assault,"Joe Biden once again demonstrated why the American people love him so much.During her confirmation hearing, Betsy DeVos was grilled by the Senate. Her lack of qualifications and opposition to public education made it clear that she should not be the Secretary of Education. But her family has bought politicians over the years so it s surprise that she had enough Republicans in her pocket to narrowly get confirmed.One of the big questions DeVos refused to answer was about sexual assault on college campuses. Under the Obama Administration, Title IX was interpreted to also mean that colleges must work to stop sexual assault on campus. When asked about this, Devos balked. Senator, I know that there s a lot of conflicting ideas and opinions around that guidance   and if confirmed I would look forward to working with you and your colleagues and understand the range of opinion and understand the issues from the higher-ed institutions that are charged with resolving these and addressing them and I would look forward to working together to find some resolutions,  DeVos said.After being pressed to answer, DeVos replied,  It would be premature for me to do that today. After being confirmed, she finally answered the question by revoking the guidance set up by President Obama and declared on the Department of Education website,  This is an issue best solved at the state and local level. In other words, DeVos is perfectly happy to continue letting rape culture continue on college campuses. She won t lift a finger to help women.And that makes Joe Biden angry. It bothers me most if Secretary DeVos is going to really dumb down Title IX enforcement,  Biden told Teen Vogue.  The real message, the real frightening message you re going to send out is, our culture says it s OK. You know, the major reason why women drop out of college when they re a freshman is because of sexual assault. Not their grades, sexual assault. And so, it would be devastating. Biden went on to slam DeVos for enabling rapists and said parents should not have to worry about safety on college campuses.No father or mother should drop their kid off this late August, early September at their first day at college and drive away worried [if she is] going to be safe. Parents don t drive away saying, Is she going to do all right in school? Is she academically qualified? Will she show up for class? How well is she going to do? That s not the conversation going on. The conversation that s going on is, is she going to be safe? That is an obligation of the school, and Title IX is the vehicle, and when Secretary DeVos by her silence didn t affirm that rape and sexual assault are forms of sexual discrimination  God, if anything is sexual discrimination, it s rape and assault. And that s why schools have an obligation under Title IX to prevent this from happening.Indeed, parents should only have to worry about how well their daughters will do in school, not about if some asshole is going to violate their bodies.By ignoring sexual assault on college campuses, Betsy DeVos is part of the problem. And when young women are raped and the rapists get away with it, DeVos should be held responsible. She is in a position of power to do something about this and if she won t do it she should be dragged into court alongside the rapist.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 16, 2017"
 Trump Celebrates Easter By Bitching About Protests Demanding His Tax Returns And Gets POUNDED For It,"Rather than just wish America a happy Easter and move on, Donald Trump spent Sunday morning whining about the Tax March protesters.Tax season gave Americans across the country the perfect opportunity to target Trump and his refusal to release his tax returns.During the campaign, Trump promised he would release his returns after the election but quickly rescinded that promise because it s clear his tax returns include many things he wants to hide, including his ties to Russia.So protests broke out over the weekend demanding that Trump finally release his taxes.His response was to complain about how he shouldn t have to release his taxes since he  won  the Electoral College. Of course, you won t hear Trump talk about the popular vote since he lost that by 3 million votes.I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2017Trump then accused the protesters of being paid to organize against him.Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2017Seriously, Trump will apparently say or do anything to ignore the fact that people really do hate him and want him impeached.His constant response to people protesting him is to brag about the election even though he colluded with the Russians to win.At this point, it s surprising that the American people haven t marched to the White House and dragged Trump kicking and screaming out of office.But instead, they mocked him repeatedly on Twitter.@realDonaldTrump Show them if it s no big deal  Mike Denison (@mikd33) April 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump Did you win the popular vote lololol  Mike Denison (@mikd33) April 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump If you ve got nothing to hide, release them.

 Melissa McCarthy Just Took On Sean Spicer’s ‘Hitler Moment’ And It’s F*cking Perfect (VIDEO),"In case you were unaware, Sean Spicer has spent much of the week attempting to justify his claim that Adolf Hitler wasn t as bad of a guy as everyone says because he drove people to concentration camps   sorry,  Holocaust centers    rather than just gas them in town like Assad does. We didn t use chemical weapons in World War II,  Spicer, apparently under the impression that Passover needed a little bit of Holocaust denial from the White House press secretary, said Tuesday.  You know, you had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons. I think when you come to sarin gas, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing,  Spicer later said in an attempt to  clarify  his remarks, forgetting about all those gas chambers in what he calls  Holocaust centers  (or, of course, the mobile execution vans). Spicer continued to apologize throughout the week, but for some inexplicable reason found himself unable to undo the damage he did when he decided that Hitler wasn t such a bad guy after all.Spicer s Hitler week had all the makings of a perfect Saturday Night Live sketch, and Melissa McCarthy did not disappoint. Dressed as Spicer in his Easter Bunny costume (if you didn t know, he played the role of the egg-delivering Easter hero during the Bush years)McCarthy s Spicer admitted that he  finally made a mistake  with the Hitler gaffe.  Everybody was like  boo hoo, well what about the Holocaust centers?' Yeah, I know they re not really called  Holocaust centers    Duh, I know that. I m aware,   Spicer  added.  I clearly meant to say,  concentration clubs,  ok? Let it drop. It would be really great if the nitpickers could try and see the big picture and didn t focus on every little slur and lie I say,  Spicey said.  That d be nice. We won t ruin any more of it for you.

 WATCH: SNL BRUTALLY Mocks The Kushner/Bannon Feud In HILARIOUS Reality Show Spoof,"Saturday Night Live is back with new episodes, and this week s cold open did not disappoint. As the iconic show went live coast-to-coast for the first time in history, they went all in on the incompetence of The Donald s reality show  presidency.   Alec Baldwin returned as the reliably buffoonish Trump, and Jimmy Fallon played the notoriously silent son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kusher. To round off the spoof, the Grim Reaper returned as the newly diminished Steve Bannon. There was even a cameo by  Mike Pence,  played by Beck Bennett, where the show ruthlessly mocked reports that Pence actually calls his wife  mother. In the spoof, Baldwin s Trump is doing a reality-show style elimination round to finally end the Kushner vs. Bannon feud that has been irritating him and amusing the rest of us for weeks now. He starts out by saying that he is holding a photo of each adviser, and only one will get to stay.  Trump  praises  Kushner  for being photogenic, while telling  Bannon  that pictures of him make him want to puke. In the end, Kushner is chosen, and another Grim Reaper-like figure comes to take  Bannon  to hell. After that, SNL kicked off what is sure to be a successful  President Kushner  narrative, as they have  Trump  tell  Kushner  to sit at the president s desk in the Oval Office, while  Trump  himself returns to the child s desk to play with his toys, just as he did in previous episodes with  President Bannon. All in all, SNL outdid themselves with this one. There are no words to describe how funny this is.Watch below for the most hilarious few minutes of your evening:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 16, 2017"
 Conservatives ADMIT They Incited Violence At Berkeley; Here’s Proof (SCREENSHOTS),"Of course, when there s violence in protests, we hear a lot of blame getting thrown around. However, the loudest cries of injustice always seem to come from those who don t believe injustice happens to anybody but them   the nationalist, racist, white supremacist alt-right. Such is the case today with the violence that erupted at the Berkeley protests. The problem is, the alt-right was all over Twitter working to incite violence against the  antifa,  or anti-fascists, whom they ve branded as terrorists.Ignoring for a moment the fact that these guys wouldn t know what actual terrorism is if it bit them, one particular person on Twitter spent much of the last six weeks telling his fellow alt-righters what to carry to Berkeley and how to set it up. They seem to think that attaching flags to sticks will disguise the fact that they re weapons.Check out what one of the  leaders,  named General Deplorable, posted to Twitter:General Deplorable s diagram up there is about how to ensure those sticks always legal, so they can carry them into  battle,  as well as how to put them together so they re harder for  enemies  to pull away from them  in battle. Here are two other tweets that are incitements to violence as well:And this is General Deplorable s Twitter profile pic and info, which actually contradict each other:Here s the thing: This crowd of miscreants calls their flag poles  based sticks.  This is what they really are:This is what #BasedStick means: a flagpole that doubles as an insurrectionist s weapon. #Berkeleyprotests https://t.co/ZD2tGdqjk0  Marie Walshe (@lacanlune) April 16, 2017The Berkeley Police Department sees these as weapons. In fact, any stick pole, post, or the like that can be used as a bludgeoning tool (along with anything else that can be used as a weapon) are prohibited. To listen to these guys talk on their social media feeds and on their livestreams, though, it s the anti-Trump protesters who started everything, and Berkeley PD is horrifically biased. Yet, look at what they confiscated:Here are some of the prohibited items that have already removed from the park today. https://t.co/3qx3smYwgk pic.twitter.com/A70VCxFYEu  Berkeley Police (@berkeleypolice) April 15, 2017The American flags belonged to the alt-right, and the black flags and red and black flags belong to what look like black bloc anarchists. Lately they ve shown up at protests and rallies specifically to cause violence. They re who every  real American  conservative thinks are the  violent liberals,  but they are a minority fringe group which currently lacks broad support.It s not likely that they ll ever change their minds on that, either.13 people were arrested and of course, General Deplorable and others are decrying the arrests and Berkeley PD for being biased towards the anti-Trump side, because of course.But they didn t go there to hold a peaceful rally. All of this shows that they went there specifically for violence.Watch a short video of melee below:Demonstrators are punching each other and even using skateboards and helmets as weapons in #Berkeley. https://t.co/PAK3WUbllH pic.twitter.com/7G8hLtsA4I  NBC Bay Area (@nbcbayarea) April 15, 2017Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"April 15, 2017"
 Sarah Palin Gleefully Counts Bodies After MOAB Strike And Gets Ripped APART By Twitter (TWEETS),"Leave it to Sarah Palin to get a hate-boner after our resident Manchurian couch potato dropped the  mother of all bombs  on ISIS. The MOAB cost $16 million (enough to completely take care of countless underprivileged families from whom Trump is stripping social programs and healthcare) and cost a whopping $300 million to develop. While some have called Trump  presidential  for learning that stupid people like big explosions, the reality is that he dropped 20,000 pounds of the American people s tax dollars in a hole and blew it all up to satisfy his ego and distract from his other problems (like Russia).On Saturday, Sarah Palin gleefully celebrated news from Afghan authorities that they had increased the number of enemy combatants killed to a whopping 94 (that s about $170,000 per dead body y all!) and a yet-unknown number of civilians.ALERT: Death Toll from MOAB Just SKYROCKETED, but News of Why Is Even Better  https://t.co/PxWje1FJmp  Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) April 16, 2017Naturally, super-Christian Palin s decision to do the happy dance over Trump s big boom extravaganza on Easter weekend was not taken lightly by people who don t still believe in that rabbit guy who hides eggs:@russboot @SarahPalinUSA Do you need to go and change your panties ?

Donald Trump Jr., hot off of tweeting that his critics were triggered,  got triggered himself after posting this tweet onto his social media account:I'm going to have to buy 5-10,000 of these to pass around to our buddies in the #MSM.

 REPORT: Trump Still Seething Like A Child Because Bannon Gets More Attention Than He Does (DETAILS),"We all remember how, in February, TIME Magazine ran a cover with the face of Stephen K. Bannon, Trump s chief strategist, on it instead of the face of Trump himself. Of course, Trump s massive ego doesn t allow one iota of attention to go to anyone else, so this definitely got under his skin. However, that was a long time ago, and one would think that Trump is over that little irritation, right? Wrong. New reporting suggests that here we are in April, months after TIME ran the Bannon cover, and Trump is still irritated over it.The Hill reports that a New York Times cover says the following of how Trump feels about the Bannon cover, and his employees in general getting more attention than he does: Mr. Trump remains annoyed by a February cover of Time magazine labeling Mr. Bannon  The Great Manipulator,  telling one visitor this month,  That doesn t just happen    a favored Trump expression for anger at subordinates who tend to their interests ahead of his. It probably doesn t help that this particular issue of TIME definitely added fuel to the fire on the  President Bannon  meme, which suggests that it is really Steve Bannon who is pulling the strings in the West Wing, and that Trump is just a puppet. This may have been true at the time; however, Bannon s power and influence in the West Wing has been greatly diminished as of late. He may even be on his way out of the White House altogether. Here is the cover that has gotten under Trump s oh so thin skin:TIME s new cover: How Steve Bannon became the second most powerful man in the world https://t.co/EJpO6Qqg9K pic.twitter.com/BdpY4Hw9Xb  TIME (@TIME) February 2, 2017If Trump is indeed still seething about the Bannon cover and the  President Bannon  narrative, indeed this is good for the country, as petty as it is.

 Trump Just Asked For The Public’s Opinion. A Former Obama Official Had The PERFECT Response (IMAGE),"Donald Trump might want to stop creating public polls  it s never going to end well for him as he is the most hated POTUS in history.It s no secret that even before Trump stepped foot in the White House, the nation was mourning the loss of President Barack Obama, stunned and heartbroken that a truly great POTUS would be replaced by an incompetent reality television star.We re now several weeks into Trump s presidency and we still can t get over it. If the average American is upset about Trump being in the White House, you can only imagine what Obama s former officials feel, having worked closely with a truly great man and leader. Today, former Obama official Chris Lu gave us a look at some major resistance to the new president.Lu was Obama s top liaison to federal departments and agencies, and clearly showed that he was fiercely loyal to the former POTUS. Trump made the mistake of asking the public what agencies he should cut   and it went horribly wrong thanks to Lu. Lu answered the question   by proposing that Trump s White House be eliminated!Trump was looking for a way to make the Federal government more efficient, effective, and accountable to you    and we can all agree that our government would be far more effective without Trump and his corrupt administration. Here s Lu s hilarious response to Trump:Lu wrote: The President seems more interested in visiting his own properties instead of fulfilling his constitutional duties. But if he wants to stay in office, he should disclose his tax returns, eliminate all conflicts of interest, and disclose who is visiting the White House. That s something we all could agree on. We have all seen how miserably Trump fails whenever he tries to get something done   four years under this administration will be detrimental to the country.Featured image via Feng Li / Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2017"
 Trump Has NEVER Looked So Incompetent; His China Adviser Was Literally Found On Amazon (DETAILS),"With every new detail revealing itself about Donald Trump s administration, the humiliation that America is enduring is getting harder and harder to stomach. We have never seen an administration fail so hard from the start, and just when it seems it can get no worse, Trump sets a new precedent. The latest detail in Trump s White House will have Americans more disappointed than ever before.Apparently, the morons in the Trump administration are so incompetent and lazy, they aren t even able to choose top officials correctly. Vanity Fair just reported a VERY disturbing detail about Trump s China adviser, who was sought out by the POTUS  son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Kushner chose this adviser not by interviewing experts, like a normal person   Kushner found Trump s China adviser by searching Amazon. Vanity Fair wrote:At one point during the campaign, when Trump wanted to speak more substantively about China, he gave Kushner a summary of his views and then asked him to do some research. Kushner simply went on Amazon, where he was struck by the title of one book, Death by China, co-authored by Peter Navarro. He cold-called Navarro, a well-known trade-deficit hawk, who agreed to join the team as an economic adviser. (When he joined, Navarro was in fact the campaign s only economic adviser.) Kushner operated in much the same way when it came to crafting Trump s tax plan calling up someone for help out of the blue. Given the initial absence of pros who could do the job properly, he also tried his hand at writing speeches. Responding to criticism from the boss ( Jared, this is terrible! ), Kushner said, according to a person familiar with the episode,  I m not a fucking speechwriter. I am a real-estate guy. The idiocy being displayed here is mind boggling. Kushner, who at least has the sense to admit that he s way out of his league and he s just  a real-estate guy , is the person Trump has put in charge of basically everything. The same man that s looking for advisers on Amazon.Let s not forget that this idiot is the man in charge of bringing peace to the Middle East. With this amount of incompetency in the White House, it will be a miracle if the United States can get through Trump s presidency without a major crisis, although we re already getting pretty close to one after Trump s attack on Syria and Afghanistan, and his inflammatory comments toward China and North Korea.If anyone thought that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were going to being the check and balance for Trump, this report certainly crushes that hope. Even the most level headed people in Trump s administration are dangerously ill-equipped.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2017"
 Americans Tar And Feather King Donald For Demanding Gold Carriage For Trip To England,"America does not have a king. America is not a monarchy. But Donald Trump apparently thinks otherwise and the American people are NOT happy about it.When President Obama visited England for the first time, he declined the gold-plated carriage the Royal family offered for his use during the state visit, opting instead to ride in a motorcade. The motorcade was not only easier to provide security for, it was less expensive and demonstrated that Obama was truly a man of the people.Donald Trump, however, is demanding that the horse-drawn gold-plated carriage be rolled out for him and that a parade be organized down the Mall to Buckingham Palace in October.Of course, we all know that Trump is NOT a man of the people no matter how much he makes that claim. After all, we re talking about a man who continues to live in a gold-plated penthouse in Trump Tower.Trump literally thinks he s a f*cking king and he is demanding to be treated like one even though the Constitution makes it clear that such titles of nobility are not recognized in this country.The cost of security is going to be massive and it s the American taxpayers who are going to be picking up the tab.As news of Trump s ridiculous demand spread, Americans took to Twitter to virtually tar and feather him in the public square of social media.While enjoying the spoils of stealing an election, The Trump Royal Crime Family requests a gold-plated carriage ride with the Royal Family. https://t.co/uRSrPoULCD  UNITE & FIGHT (@stopthenutjob) April 15, 2017@kurteichenwald They should give Trump his ride on gold carriage   off a cliff.

 WTF: Trump Is ALREADY Paying Himself For His 2020 Campaign (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is already running for re-election, with a campaign fund set up and everything. And just as he did with his 2016 campaign, he s using the campaign to funnel money into his wallet via his businesses, because why patronize anybody else, and pay them all those campaign donations, when you can just pay yourself with them?Thus far, that amount totals $500,000. $274,000 alone has gone to Trump Tower. $58,000-plus has gone to the Trump International Golf Club in Florida, and nearly $14,000 has gone to Trump s Las Vegas hotel. The rest has gone to various other properties.Federal election law requires any candidate who uses their own business for campaign purposes to reimburse said business for the market value of the goods or services used. Generally, this winds up being a whole one to two percent of total campaign expenditures. As of June 2016, Trump s expenditures at his own properties was more than $6 million, or 10 percent of his total campaign expenditures.By the Nov. 8 election, that amount was over $14 million.That part of election law actually forms a loophole that Trump has no problem taking advantage of to the fullest extent he can.Obama stopped fundraising for awhile following his election in 2008. Trump never did. As soon as he was elected, he and the RNC began fundraising for 2020, and thus far, they ve raised more than $42 million together. Trump s refusal to divest himself from his businesses means some of that money could very easily be literally going into his wallet as we speak.Given that this is probably the least transparent administration in a long time, there s no way to trust that this is all Trump will funnel into his pockets. He s a master at exploiting loopholes in the law. His supporters will probably chant,  There s nothing illegal about this, so shut up,  but legal doesn t mean right or ethical.The fact that he s already busy funneling campaign donations to his own pockets just adds to the growing stack of items illustrating just how unethical he really is.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2017"
 Trump Just Went Full Hypocrite On National Parks And He’s Getting TRASHED For It,"Donald Trump is a hypocrite and even conservative outdoor groups know it.America s greatest and most enduring treasure is its National Parks. Conservation of these lands started under Republican President Theodore Roosevelt and has continued to this day as every president has created new National Parks to preserve natural wonders for future generations to enjoy and appreciate.But Donald Trump is on a mission to destroy everything that is good in this country and one of his targets are the very National Parks that millions of Americans visit every year.Trump s 2018 budget slashes funding for the Interior Department, which includes the National Park Service, by $2 billion and he has signed an executive order making it easier for mining and drilling to occur in and around the parks.In short, Trump doesn t want to give the National Park Service the money to protect the parks and he wants to let oil companies pollute them.Despite these facts, Trump had the gall to pretend that he loves our National Parks and that he wants to protect them.In a proclamation issued on Friday, Trump declared that protecting America s national parks is important to him and his administration. It is a priority of my Administration to protect these magnificent lands, and to ensure all Americans have access to our national parks, as well as to other National Park Service sites, throughout the next century It is my hope that we will pass down these natural and historic sites to our children and grandchildren. Again, Trump s budget would hurt our National Parks and mining and drilling would do lasting damage to lands that are supposed to remain pristine for future generations to come.In response to Trump s proclamation, conservation organizations trashed his hypocrisy. We re really surprised and disappointed to see the administration come after national parks this way,  senior manager for the National Park Conservation Association Nicholas Lund said.  With all that s going on in the world, drilling in our national parks should just not be a priority. Even the conservative-leaning Sierra Club had strong words for Trump. If he actually cared about protecting our parks, he would have never proposed a budget that slashes their funding to historically low levels at a time when investments are needed to maintain America s best idea,  executive director Michael Brune said.  Our parks and the people and economies they support need real commitments, not empty gestures. Indeed, our National Parks directly benefit the communities around them because of tourists, campers, hunters, photographers, and a multitude of people who desire to see America s natural wonders, the same natural wonders that their ancestors saw years earlier.That s what is at stake here. The National Parks belong to the people and they should be protected for all time, not exploited.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2017"
" White Grievance Princess Tomi Lahren Whines About Getting ‘Fired,’ And I Could Watch It All Day (VIDEO)","Recently Tomi Lahren   a woman who literally built a career on hate at Glenn Beck s TheBlaze tried to make herself seem less horrible than she actually is during an appearance on The View and said that her  limited government  stance included being pro-choice. Unfortunately for Lahren, while she could get away with making racist comment after racist comment, the one thing conservatives will not tolerate is a woman speaking out about having rights to anything   especially her body.Some are rushing to Lahren s defense after Glenn Beck fired her for expressing the one viewpoint she has (assuming it s legitimate) that isn t completely horrifying, and she is taking that encouragement and running with it. Recently, Lahren filed a lawsuit against Beck alleging wrongful termination   and she stopped by ABC News to whine about how unfair it is that she got fired from her position as an extreme-right propagandist because she said something that was contrary to conservatives  core  values  (that word is used as loosely as possible). My job is my life. This is my life. Without that, I feel lost,  Lahren told ABC News   Nightline  on Friday.  When your outlet is taken away from you and you don t understand why and you re so disappointed and you re so blindsided, it hurts. I was getting ready to go in and do my show and I got a phone call saying that show was not on,  have been suspended for a week, perhaps longer ,  Lahren whined.  I was flabbergasted. Lahren s lawsuit, like her persona, is as fake as any randomly-selected promise from the mouth of Donald Trump. She has not been fired and instead remains under contract. Most importantly, she is still getting paid. It is puzzling that an employee who remains under contract (and is still being paid) has sued us for being fired, especially when we continue to comply fully with the terms of our agreement with her,  TheBlaze told ABC in a statement. She will continue to be paid until her contract expires in September but feels that her  First Amendment rights  (the First Amendment only applies to government interference) were violated when Beck decided that he didn t want someone walking around talking like women are people.Nevertheless, Lahren complains that she had been  silenced  and  sidelined  just like all those minorities she hates. I don t sit down in my chair and deliver my  Final Thoughts,  I don t have a dressing room, so I m terminated, I m fired  the way I look at things, I m not doing what I was contracted to do, which was produce a television show, a political talk show,  Lahren sobbed. This is not about politics,  she says.  This is about someone who had an opposing viewpoint that has been silenced and sidelined and thrown away. But, of course, that s what you do with garbage   you throw it away (and, according to the lawsuit, stretch yellow  CAUTION  tape across the door of its dressing room). I m someone with a thick skin and I can stand up to about anybody,  the thin-skinned bully said.  But when somebody does that that s really hard for me to take in Loyalty is everything to me, and you can disagree with me, but to go out and try to humiliate me? Very, very disappointed. I m a human being at the end of the day and something has been stripped from me and that s my ability to work, that s my ability to have a voice,  Lahren told ABC without providing any of the much-needed evidence that she is, in reality, human.  That s been taken from me wrongfully. So I m upset by it, and I m hurt by it and I feel betrayed by it. Interestingly, her  pro-choice  comments don t exactly mix well with her numerous aspersions cast at women who correctly believe they have a right to make decisions regarding their own bodies.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Tomi On AbortionIt's over, folks.

" Trump Demands Queen Of Britain Pick Him Up In Gold-Plated Carriage, Organize Parade During Visit","Trump ran on  fiscal responsibility,  but has since made it clear that it doesn t apply to him.In yet another intentional embarrassment, details have leaked regarding Trump s demands for his upcoming state visit to England. They are petty and childish, and have infuriated much of England.Trump is said to have asked the Queen of England to pick him up in a gold-plated horse-drawn carriage and be given a parade as he makes his way to Buckingham Palace for an official visit.Donald Trump waving from the Queen s royal carriage is not a scenario many would have foreseen a year ago, but it has become a very real prospect, forcing security services to plan an unprecedented lockdown.The White House has made clear it regards the carriage procession down the Mall as an essential element of the itinerary for the visit currently planned for the second week of October, according to officials.This may be another petty attempt by Trump to appear  better  than his predecessor, President Obama. The former president had repeatedly told the English government that it was not expected to drive him around in a gold chariot, citing cost and security.Trump, who views appearances as everything, has a different perspective. Who would have thought?Their living room Trump tower. Gold leaf walls-that's normal pic.twitter.com/uZqPKRXg4Q  Debra Kamin (@ubucky) July 30, 2016For the English government, Trump s request is said to be a financial, security and logistical nightmare. The Times again:One source said that Mr Trump s decision to opt for the carriage, rather than the bullet and bomb-proof car that was used by his predecessor presented a range of fresh headaches.The source said:  The vehicle which carries the president of the United States is a spectacular vehicle. It is designed to withstand a massive attack like a low-level rocket grenade. If he s in that vehicle he is incredibly well protected and on top of that it can travel at enormous speed. If he is in a golden coach being dragged up the Mall by a couple of horses, the risk factor is dramatically increased. The result is that London will go into lockdown mode not seen since the Olympics. The crushing financial burden will, of course, be footed by the English taxpayer. Trump, who makes his Secret Service detail rent their own golf courses when he plays golf at his own course, is not expected to chip in any money.Trump s expectations to be treated as nobility is a further insult to the British people, 1.8 million of whom recently signed a petition asking that Trump be banned from the country entirely. At several times, Parliament has debated whether to forbid Trump from entering England due to his history of racism and sexism. During the fiesty debate, two British PMs got into a heated exchange which culminated in this epic zinger:Carmichael:  Having offered a state visit [to Trump] this time, what will we offer the next time we want to get a favorable response? Salmond:  The crown jewels. Sadly, watching Trump prance around London in gold, the joke doesn t seem like much of a joke any longer.Featured image via Stefan Wermuth   WPA Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2017"
 Local Fox Affiliate Just Gave Fox News A GIANT Middle Finger Over Their Biased News,"A local news station in Boston has had it with the Fox brand damaging their own reputation. WFXT Channel 25 is going to change the name of its newscast to Boston 25 News removing  Fox  entirely following a drop in its ratings and a study that showed their audience saw the newscast as  leaning conservative. Fox News itself has some ridiculous shows, like Fox & Friends and The O Reilly Factor, both of which tend to peddle not just misleading information, but also the very attitudes that make things worse, not better, in this country. For instance, on Fox & Friends this morning, Brian Kilmeade whined about conditions in immigration detention centers. But he wasn t talking about the stunning human rights abuses. He s upset about this: Get this: They re enjoying seven hours of outdoor activity. Who gets that anymore? Fresh sheets, and absolutely   I don t get that. No need to learn English. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt added: Seven hours of outdoor activity, freshly washed sheets, and absolutely no need to learn English. That s the easy life of an illegal immigrant inside American jails. Or clean sheets have something to do with basic sanitation, but hey, they ll think what they want here. The outdoor activity   it s not like they re in some Eden-like garden of paradise.There s also the whole controversy with Bill O Reilly and sexual harassment, and Fox News  failure to deal with their male employees who engage in such behavior. Billo the Clown is still on the air, and so far, Fox doesn t seem to have done much about it.Who wants to be associated with this crapola? WFXT is actually owned by Cox Media Group and not Fox News, but they re still considered a Fox affiliate and the brand carries a reputation that is increasingly negative. Massachusetts is a deep blue state, and their businesses and media outlets need to act accordingly to continue reaching their audiences.This decision is actually a few years in the making   it didn t just happen. WFXT s news director, Mike Oliveria, said that Massachusetts viewers want unbiased news. Fox News is decidedly not unbiased, but WFXT strives to be, as do most local newscasts. He said: It s not that [Fox is] a bad brand; it s just that it s not ours. While other Fox affiliates under Cox Media s umbrella aren t considering dropping  Fox  from their names at this time, we have t wonder if that s going to change.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2017"

" BREAKING: Trump Is Playing With Fire, And He Just Brought Us One Step Closer To Nuclear War","North Korea just made it abundantly clear that they have no intention of backing down from Trump, and that Trump, for all his dick-swinging, does not scare them. In fact, according to the U.K. s Mirror, North Korea just let loose with a blistering warning to Trump over his posturing: Our toughest counteraction against the US and its vassal forces will be taken in such a merciless manner as not to allow the aggressors to survive.We ve got a powerful nuclear deterrent already in our hands and we certainly will not keep our arms crossed in the face of a US pre-emptive strike. Their vice foreign minister also added this: Whatever comes from the US, we will cope with it. We are fully prepared. The army and people will courageously counter those who encroach upon our dignity and sovereignty and will always mercilessly ravage all provocative options of the US. They ve also flat-out said,  We will go to war if they choose,  clearly putting the ball in our court as to whether or not war happens.Trump reportedly threatened to hit North Korea with Tomahawks the same missiles we launched into Syria to destroy absolutely nothing if they go ahead with a nuclear test this weekend. But that s not all   we also recently test-dropped an inert nuclear bomb to ensure that our military planes can carry and deliver it.There s a slim chance we could decide to use that on North Korea.It s not that North Korea isn t a problem. It s that this military show is having the opposite effect of what Trump no doubt thinks should be happening, despite North Korea being a very aggressive regime. And there will be collateral damage if we launch a pre-emptive strike at North Korea. They ll hit our bases in South Korea, but they may also retaliate directly against our allies in the region, including Japan.If it s nuclear war, well, the whole world will suffer.China is begging both us and North Korea to cool it. Russia has also asked both countries to be very careful. South Korea has warned us not to start anything on the peninsula without their consent as a military ally. Trump has got to stop fanning his peacock feathers and actually start considering the wider consequences of his actions, including show he s putting on near the Korean peninsula at the moment.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2017"
 China Warns Trump: Provoke North Korea And ‘Pay The Price’,"On Thursday, Donald Trump tweeted that if China, North Korea s sole major ally, doesn t deal with North Korea  properly,  the United States and  its allies  will. Now China is neither an ally or enemy of the United States , but they are a major power with around 300 nuclear warheads and the largest army in the world  a fact many of our allies would consider before backing us in any war that might involve them. Trump would, as well, if he had any interest in averting World War III. But, as Trump says,  I love war. We call on all parties to refrain from provoking and threatening each other, whether in words or actions, and not let the situation get to an irreversible and unmanageable stage,  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters in Beijing, hoping to appeal to Trump s better nature and forgetting that he doesn t have one. If a war occurs, the result is a situation in which everybody loses and there can be no winner,  Yi added on Friday during a joint press conference with his French counterpart. Lately, tensions have risen with the US and [South Korea] on one side, and [North Korea] on the other, and one has the feeling that a conflict could break out at any moment,  Yi said, adding that the side provoking the conflict (Trump in this case or, more correctly, the taxpayers he represents) must assume the historic responsibility and pay the corresponding price. As the world worries about what Trump will do to satisfy his massive ego   especially after dropping the  mother of all bombs  recently   he seems nonplussed, spending his weekend golfing instead of worrying about the crisis he has helped exacerbate.Will Trump risk a world war and a gigantic hit to the United States  treasury? I think we all know the answer to that:  as soon as he is done golfing. Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"April 14, 2017"
" Jake Tapper STUNNED By Trump’s Stupidity, SHREDS His Denial Of Global Warming (VIDEO)","If there s one thing Donald Trump has an extremely hard time accepting, it s evidence and facts. It doesn t matter how much proven, scientifically backed data you put in front of the undeserving POTUS   his first impulse is to whine about how biased and dishonest the information is, even when it comes to something as serious and common sense as climate change.On Friday, CNN s Jake Tapper tore Trump a new one by making fun of his denial of what is happening to our environment. In a segment on Australia s Great Barrier Reef, Tapper mocked Trump for previously calling global warming a hoax invented by the Chinese. As Tapper spoke about coral bleaching and the effects that the rising temperatures have had on the Great Barrier Reef, Tapper stated that coral bleaching was  proof that climate change, at least partially man made, is destroying the planet,  noting that  once-colorful coral reefs off the coast of Australia are now being bleached white. Then Tapper made sure that no one forgot that the current President of the United States is an absolute moron. Perfectly explaining why Trump s climate change denial is devastating, Tapper said: This news comes at a time at a time President Trump has proposed cutting billions of dollars from programs to study and help combat the effects of climate change which in the past he s called a  Chinese hoax.  It is, of course, not a Chinese hoax. It s seriously depressing to know that the man in the White House has called climate change a hoax. At a time when we cannot trust our President to make decent decisions on behalf of our country (let alone the planet), we re lucky to have reporters like Tapper reminding us that denying facts has serious consequences.

 Democrats Just CRUSHED A Bunch Of Republicans In Illinois Because Of Backlash Against Trump,"The Democratic wave has commenced.In 2010, Republicans gloated about the Tea Party wave that gave them control of the House and have since been bragging about the conservative  wave  that gave them control of the Senate and the White House in 2016.But because of Donald Trump and his incompetence, Republicans are now staring at an oncoming Democratic wave that could sweep them out of power.Unlike the Republican wave, however, the Democratic wave has genuine grassroots support and it s looking more like a growing tsunami.In Illinois, Democrats demonstrated this firsthand by taking down a bunch of Republicans in local elections in places they had never won before.According to the Huffington Post,The city of Kankakee elected its first African-American, Democratic mayor. West Deerfield Township will be led entirely by Democrats for the first time. Elgin Township voted for  a complete changeover,  flipping to an all-Democratic board. Normal Township elected Democratic supervisors and trustees to run its board   the first time in more than 100 years that a single Democrat has held a seat. We had a pretty good day,  said Dan Kovats, executive director of the Illinois Democratic County Chairmen s Association.  We won in areas we normally would win, but we also won in areas Republicans never expected us to be competitive in. They were caught flat-footed. Republicans apparently thought their seats were safe and that they would be able to easily run over their opponents for victory. But that did not happen last week.Donald Trump has done such a horrible job since taking office that even people who voted for him are seeing the light and turning on him.Because as it turns out, Trump s policies are going to hurt conservatives more. His attempt to kill the Affordable Care Act would have stripped millions of Americans of their healthcare. Trump is also launching assaults on Social Security and Medicare, environmental protections, education, etc And it s only getting worse as Trump is now close to dragging America into more wars as more fighting breaks out in the Middle East and North Korea makes threats.Trump has repeatedly proven that he doesn t give a damn about the American people. He only cares about himself and Americans who never paid attention to politics before are waking up and getting involved.That brings us back to the wins by Illinois Democrats and the rising tide that could bury Republicans in 2018 if they don t reverse course fast.Democrats are literally running competitive races and winning in areas that are dominated by a conservative population.They should be striking fear in the hearts and minds of every Republican lawmaker across the country right now. Because if Democrats can win here, they can win anywhere and even Republicans in the most staunchly Republican stronghold are not safe.These may have been just some local elections but grassroots efforts are the tip of the spear.At the state level, Republicans have also been struggling to keep long-held seats. A Kansas special election almost turned into a win for Democrats if not for a last minute flood of cash into the race by the Republican Party.And Democrats in Georgia are running a winning anti-Trump campaign that could give them another seat in the House that had traditionally been held by the GOP.Republicans also got their asses handed to them in Delaware by a Democrat running a similar campaign.In short, Trump has poisoned the Republican Party and Republicans only have themselves to blame. They picked Trump to be their leader, and he is now the face of their party. Everything he does reflects on them and the American people are incredibly angry about what Trump has been doing to our nation over the last three months. He has made us a laughingstock around the world.However, Republicans won t be laughing when the 2018 Election rolls around. They ll be devastated. And so will Donald Trump, because a Democratic wave in 2018 means he s likely to be a failed one-term president.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2017"

 Agency Targets Trump In First Ever Protest From Space: ‘LOOK AT THAT YOU SON OF A BITCH’ (VIDEO),"This past January we all witnessed one of the largest, most significant protests in history as millions of people across the globe took part in the Women s March on Washington, but another group has a message for Donald Trump and has quite literally taken it to the next level.Showing support for the upcoming March for Science which will take place on Earth Day, April 22, the Autonomous Space Agency Network, or ASAN, has launched the first ever protest from space. While their protest doesn t physically include millions of people, you can bet that millions are supporting it as we are forced to watch Trump s administration withdraw funding from agencies like NASA s Earth Science program which was put in place to protect our planet from climate change, and don t forget that during Trump s presidential campaign, he vowed to do away with the Environmental Protection Agency, saying,  We re going to get rid of it in almost every form.

 Anti-Defamation League LITERALLY Schools Sean Spicer; Offers To Be His Tutor On Holocaust (LETTER),"After White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer decided he would say Adolf Hitler wasn t as bad as Syrian President Assad,  as well as claim that Hitler never gassed his people, many people were outraged, and justifiably so.Either Spicer is an absolute moron, or he truly doesn t believe the atrocities that were committed by Nazi Germany to their own people, primarily those who were Jewish, and the people of neighboring regions.Offering to basically be Spicer s tutor on the Holocaust because he is so clearly a moron, the Anti-Defamation League s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt wrote the press secretary a letter.Here s the letter in full: Dear Mr. Spicer:This week Jews around the world have spent time with their families celebrating Passover, the feast of freedom. In the Passover liturgy, we read that in each generation there will be those who rise up to harm the Jewish people, much like Pharaoh in ancient times and Hitler in modern times. Understanding and being keenly aware of our history   to  never forget    is part of Passover and part of the Jewish experience.Unfortunately, when the first days of Passover ended and we turned on our phones and televisions yesterday evening, we learned about your comment that Hitler did not gas his own people. Your comparisons between Assad and Hitler were not only historically inaccurate but they also were inappropriate and offensive.While you have apologized, this week s incident as well as others (notably, the International Holocaust Remembrance Day statement omitting Jews and your vociferous defense of it), have exposed a serious gap in your knowledge of the Holocaust, its impact, and the lessons we can learn from it.For decades, ADL has been at the forefront of Holocaust education, providing trainings about the Nazi atrocities to a wide range of groups. We have conducted trainings for more than 130,000 law enforcement professionals and more than 35,447 educators, reaching more than 1,000,000 students. Our programs provide historical context for how the Holocaust was able to occur; teach the Holocaust as a human story; and create opportunities for critical thinking. Each of these educational programs focuses on the consequences of unchecked bigotry and hate.ADL would be happy to conduct one of these trainings at your convenience for you, your staff, and anyone at the White House who may need to learn more about the Holocaust. We know you are very busy, but we believe a few hours learning this history will help you understand where you went wrong and prevent you from making these mistakes in the future.Sincerely,Jonathan A. Greenblatt CEO Anti-Defamation League Hopefully, Spicer takes the ADL up on their offer and gets the education he so clearly needs. In addition, he still needs to be fired.Featured Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2017"
 Amazon Facing Mounting Pressure To Stop Funding Hate By Advertising On Breitbart (DETAILS),"A few years ago, very few people even knew what Breitbart.com was. It was a fringe website that only white supremacists and other bigots frequented, and the people who posted anonymously there almost certainly didn t voice their views publicly. All of that changed in 2015 when Donald Trump began running for president.Trump s campaign brought white supremacy mainstream, as he regularly retweeted neo-Nazis, refused to immediately disavow former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, and readily embraced the white supremacist  alt-right.  Breitbart itself went completely mainstream when Stephen K. Bannon, who ran the place, left its stewardship to become Trump s campaign CEO.Now that Breitbart and its toxic brand of hate is literally steps from the Oval Office, people who are opposed to its hateful ideology are putting pressure on major retailers to pull their advertising dollars from the right-wing hate site. The latest to receive such pressure is online retail giant Amazon.According to The Hill, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was asked by more than 500 of his employees via email to stop funding hate by advertising on Breitbart. In another exchange during a meeting, another high-ranking Amazon official, Jeff Blackburn, was asked point blank by an employee to kill the Breitbart advertising because the site  regularly publishes hateful and bigoted content.  One employee said the following of her experiences since people now know what Breitbart is: When people find out I work at Amazon, the first question they ask is - How can you justify working for Amazon when they advertise on a hate site?' Now, Amazon is being heckled from outside its own ranks as well.More than 500,000 signatures have been accumulated on a petition that demands Amazon stop investing in hate  via its Breitbart advertising.Perhaps the most effective effort will come from the social media activist group Sleeping Giant, which has successfully gotten more than 1,800 companies to cease and desist with the Breitbart advertising. Major companies that caved to the pressure include BMV, Nordstrom (the company that infamously yanked Ivanka s clothing line), and Kellogg.Keep the pressure on, folks. Boycotts and bad headlines work. Personally, I ll be using jet.com until Amazon gets its act together.Featured image via screen capture from Talk Android",News,"April 13, 2017"
" Here’s How Trump Is Going To F*CK Us Into WWIII, And It Doesn’t Actually Start In The Middle East","Has anybody ever wondered whether all these acts of war, including the MOAB we just dropped on Afghanistan, are just distractions from the growing Russia scandal? Considering the fact that he won t say whether he actually authorized the MOAB strike, it s not too far-fetched to wonder if this was to distract us from news that our intelligence community may have concrete information showing his campaign colluded with Russia during the election.But the MOAB we just dropped on Afghanistan may not be all. Trump is threatening North Korea, too, in a more direct way than saying,  See my giant penis bomb? You shouldn t mess with me. We already sent a strike force across the Pacific to intimidate Kim Jong Un, who s been shooting missiles into the Sea of Japan lately. North Korea is now talking about conducting a nuclear test within the next few days, and the Trump administration has threatened to hit them with Tomahawks if they do so.But that s not all   there may well be an attempt to get  boots on the ground  in North Korea as well:The intelligence officials told NBC News that the U.S. has positioned two destroyers capable of shooting Tomahawk cruise missiles in the region, one just 300 miles from the North Korean nuclear test site.American heavy bombers are also positioned in Guam to attack North Korea should it be necessary, and earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group was being diverted to the area.The U.S. strike could include missiles and bombs, cyber and special operations on the ground.Because that s totally the way to cow a foreign power. North Korea has warned that if we launch a pre-emptive strike against them, they could launch a nuke at us. Hot air? Maybe. But it would be better for Trump to take it seriously than strut around with his penis peacock feathers on full display right up until they actually do it.If dropping the biggest non-nuclear bomb in our arsenal isn t enough to scare them, then nothing will be. If we launch missiles at North Korea in a pre-emptive strike for a nuclear test, we ve committed an act of war, and no matter how we justify it, we ve made ourselves a threat to the entire world by provoking a nuclear power.And North Korea may or may not retaliate directly against us. While they ve threatened to  hit the U.S. first,  with a nuke should we strike, they might decide to hit South Korea, or even Japan, in retaliation for such an attack. In fact, Japan is worried that North Korea could send missiles tipped with sarin gas warheads their way. Sarin gas is the gas that Assad used on his people last week.In other words, Trump s aggressive actions have consequences he doesn t seem to understand. He s a macho peacock strutting around trying to convince the world that he s a bad-ass with a giant penis military at his disposal. Our military is not a toy, and bombs are not a toy, and neither are signals of strength in the situations in which Trump is using them. He needs to go. He s the biggest threat to the world we ve seen in decades.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 13, 2017"
 Democrats Demand Jared Kushner Be Stripped Of Security Clearance,"Donald Trump s son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, conveniently forgot to mention a slew of foreign contacts, including several meetings with high-profile Russian operatives, when he applied for his security clearance. Now, Democrats are demanding that Kushner s security clearance be revoked in light of his failure to disclose the meetings.Five House Democrats penned a letter to FBI Director James Comey and National Background Investigations Director Charles Phalen on Thursday, calling for Kushner to lose his security clearance. Mr. Kushner s lack of candor about meetings with Russian officials appears to be part of a larger pattern of dissembling and deception on Russian contacts from the Trump team, and we believe the public deserves the truth about what connection, if any, exists between these incidents,  they wrote.The letter was signed by Don Beyer of Virginia, Ted Lieu of California, Jerrold Nadler of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Peter Welch of Vermont. The Democrats said they were particularly concerned about an article in the New York Times that reported Kushner had  omitted dozens of contacts with foreign leaders.  They noted that this story did not receive the scrutiny it deserved. The lawmakers added a reminder that  falsifying or concealing information on a SF-86 questionnaire is a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. Given the severity of the allegations and still unanswered questions about this administration s recently uncovered covert dealings with Russian government and intelligence officials, we are requesting that Mr. Kushner s interim top-secret security clearance be suspended pending a review of Mr. Kushner s compliance with the laws and regulation governing security clearance. The Democrats are also calling on Kushner to make public all of the meetings he had during the time of Trump s transition.According to Kushner s aides, he has been under an  interim  security clearance so far while the FBI has been gathering information on him. Kushner is also set to face an interview with Senate Intelligence Committee regarding his contacts with Russia.Via screen shotFeatured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 13, 2017"
" This Guy Predicted Trump’s Win, And What He Has To Say Now Should TERRIFY Republicans","The media, and to a certain extent, the pollsters, got it seriously wrong when they predicted an easy win for Hillary Clinton in last year s election. Okay, technically it was, but our Electoral College said otherwise. One professor, though, warned the United States that Trump was going to win. Now, that same professor is predicting that Trump will be impeached.Allan Lichtman, a professor at American University, reached meme-status last fall for predicting long before anyone else that Trump would win, using a formula based on the popularity of the party in control of the White House that accurately predicted the eight previous presidential elections. Now Lichtman wants everyone to pay attention to the rest of what came through his crystal ball   that Trump will now be impeached.Source: PoliticoTrump, naturally, loved Lichtman s initial prediction. #45 Elect even sent him a note. Taking time out of preparing to become the world s most powerful leader, he wrote me a personal note, saying  Professor   Congrats   good call,  Lichtman writes in  The Case for Impeachment,  an advance copy of which was shared with POLITICO.  What Trump overlooked, however, was my  next big prediction : that, after winning the presidency, he would be impeached. Trump, of course, didn t investigate any further. If he had, he would realize that Lichtman may have predicted Trump, but that doesn t mean he supports him. In fact, he calls the despot (my word)  an existential threat to humanity. Lichtman s list of possible offenses that could get Trump to that point are familiar: charges of treason with Russia, abuse of power and emoluments violations. Lichtman also cites now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, then a senator, who argued that a president could be impeached for offenses committed before he took office. Among those potential offenses, Lichtman lists Trump s housing violations, charity problems, potential violations of the Cuba embargo and Trump University.It s all part of a brief   designed to be damning   tour through Trump s history. It includes section headings like  Trump Towers Become Vacant Lots  and  Lying His Way to the Presidency.  It eventually leads Lichtman to the conclusion that Trump might serve himself up for impeachment:  Trump s disregard for lying in sworn testimony, examined in the context of the Bill Clinton precedent, shows how Trump s opponents could set an impeachment trap for him through a civil lawsuit. It wouldn t take much. If Democrats regain the House in 2018, Trump s impeachment is all but guaranteed, but even now, if enough Republicans turn on him, it could easily happen.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 13, 2017"
 Australia’s Ex-Foreign Minister Responds To Trump’s Failing Presidency; America Should Listen (VIDEO),"At this point in Donald Trump s pathetic, failing presidency, it is no surprise that officials from other countries want nothing to do with him or America. The country has been humiliated beyond belief as the orange child in the White House unleashes his reckless behavior on the world, and top officials are doing their best to do damage control.This week, Gareth Evans, the former Foreign Minister of Australia, sent out a major warning about Trump and urged Australia to gain more independence away from the United States thanks to Trump s trigger-happy behavior and recent attack on Syria. Evans railed against Trump in his speech to Australia s National Press Club, calling Trump manifestly the most ill-informed, under-prepared, ethically challenged and psychologically ill-equipped president in US history. Evans correctly observed that Trump should not be trusted to deliver consistent, coherent, constructive and cohesive outcomes over the next four years.  The former Australia Foreign Minster added: Personally driven by instinct and impulse, unhampered by knowledge or judgement, he has led an administration acting so far manifestly on the basis of postures, not of policies. Evans urged Australia to depend more on itself and partners in Asia than on the United States, as Trump has made a partnership with America far too risky. Evans said: We should have learned that lesson after Iraq in 2003. You can watch Evans blast Trump s dangerous behavior below:Americans should be seriously considering what other world leaders and important officials are saying about Trump. The fact that the rest of the world is horrified by what they see should be setting off red flags even among Trump s own supporters. Never before have we seen such a response from the world, as Trump threatens to ruin everything he can get his tiny hands on.

 Trump Administration In FREE FALL After ‘Concrete Evidence’ Linking Trump To Russia Emerges (DETAILS),"Donald Trump s undeserved time in the White House may soon come to a gloriously relieving end as one of his biggest scandals threatens to blow up in his face.According to a source close to the investigation examining the ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, there is now specific concrete and corroborative evidence  that Trump s inner circle colluded with Russian operatives during the presidential election. The Guardian reported that the U.K. s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), which has been watching over the Trump campaign since 2015, has noted several shady  interactions  going on between Trump s people and Russian agents.The GCHQ hadn t been necessarily looking for this information but picked it up during routine surveillance. It wasn t long before other intelligence agencies began to see the same pattern. The U.S. also received information from the  Five Eyes  alliance (U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand) and European agencies in Germany, Estonia, and Poland. The Guardian reported: It is understood that GCHQ was at no point carrying out a targeted operation against Trump or his team or proactively seeking information. The alleged conversations were picked up by chance as part of routine surveillance of Russian intelligence assets. Over several months, different agencies targeting the same people began to see a pattern of connections that were flagged to intelligence officials in the US. With all of this gathered intelligence taken into consideration, the source close to the investigation said: They now have specific concrete and corroborative evidence of collusion. This is between people in the Trump campaign and agents of [Russian] influence relating to the use of hacked material. They [the European agencies] were saying:  There are contacts going on between people close to Mr Trump and people we believe are Russian intelligence agents. You should be wary of this.  The message was:  Watch out. There s something not right.' As this investigation continues and collusion is confirmed, we might be looking at the end of Trump and his corrupt administration.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 13, 2017"
" GOP Pundit Compared Trump’s Healthcare Disaster To Martin Luther King, Jr.; He Quickly Regretted It (VIDEO)","Being a pro-Trump pundit must be a tough racket right now.

One of the panelists on CNN Thursday morning happened to be African-American commentator Symone Sanders. As you can imagine, things did not go well for Lord.In a segment discussing the president s plans for Obamacare, Lord called Trump  the Martin Luther King of health care.  Sanders interjected with an  Oh Jeffrey,  but Lord went on,  When I was a kid, President Kennedy did not want to introduce the Civil Rights bill because he said it wasn t popular, he didn t have the votes for it. Dr. King kept putting people in the streets in harm s way to put the pressure on. That s when Sanders stepped in to quash his metaphor:Okay Jeffrey. You do understand that Dr. King was marching for Civil Rights because people that looked like me were being beaten? Dogs were being sicced on them? Basic human rights were being withheld from these people merely because of the color of their skin?

 Is Nothing Sacred? Ivanka Trump’s Passover Family Photo Has Been Exposed As A Fake,"There are big scandals   like Trump s ties to Russia, his repeated flaunting of conflict of interest violations, the nepotism   and then there are small ones. It s the small ones that are most disturbing because of how completely avoidable they are. The Trump family just assumes you re too stupid to notice.Here s a particularly galling example:Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump released a family photo during Passover. That, in and of itself, wouldn t be newsworthy except for the fact that it was a much-needed break from the Trump administration s repugnant treatment of the Jewish community. Kushner s Jewish faith is extremely important to Trump because his staff is rife with anti-Semitic thinkers.Trump s advisor Steve Bannon is a life-long anti-Semite, whose own wife once said he refused to allow his daughters to attend a school with Jewish kids. Trump s Press Secretary Sean Spicer went on a nonsensical Holocaust denial rant and only apologized hours later when the nation of Israel openly said he needed to resign. Trump s inner circle includes a guy who pledged an oath of loyalty to a pro-fascist Nazi-allied group. In the middle of all of this, Trump no-showed on a Passover seder dinner the White House hosted.So a photograph of Trump s daughter and son-in-law, two key members of his team, celebrating a Jewish holiday might send a positive message to the country. However, like clockwork, even Kushner s Passover family photo quickly turned into something offensive.It turns out that the photo was not, in fact, taken during his Passover celebration. It is an old photo taken on what seems like the Sunday after the inauguration. CNN s Betsy Klein noticed that fact when she realized the entire Trump clan was wearing the same outfits they were photographed in during services at the National Cathedral.It appears the Passover Trump-Kushner family photo was taken the Sunday after inauguration following services at the National Cathedral: pic.twitter.com/p0htM7V8Pi  Betsy Klein (@betsy_klein) April 13, 2017Just so incredibly lazy.

The Republican congressman told his constituents that taxpayers don t pay his salary and saying otherwise is  bullcrap. You say you pay for me to do this? That s bullcrap,  video shows Mullin saying. I pay for myself. I paid enough taxes before I got here and continue to through my company to pay my own salary. This is a service. No one here pays me to go,  he added.Go figure, no one was impressed with his remarks. When his constituents pushed back, Mullin tried to spin his comments, saying,  this is a service for me, not a career, and I thank God this is not how I make my living. Amy Lawrence, Mullin s spokeswoman, told the press that he was just trying to say that he doesn t want to be a  career politician,  that s all. The congressman reiterates in the video that his work as the representative of the Second District of Oklahoma is a service,  Lawrence said. His aspiration is to be a career legislator and not a career politician. He is not, nor does he ever aspire to be, a career politician. His priority will always be to serve his constituents to the best of his ability. Mullins owns Mullin Plumbing, a lucrative company with multiple smaller subsidiaries. But comprehending exactly how this negates the salary he earns as a congressman requires a special type of mental gymnastics. For the record, base pay for a U. S. congressman is $174,000.The good news for Mullin is that after telling his constituents that they don t pay his salary, he probably won t have to worry about the possibility of becoming a career politician.You can watch Mullin sabotage his career below: Featured image via Wikipedia",News,"April 13, 2017"
 GOP Rep Gets RIPPED APART After Saying Sean Spicer Was Right About Hitler,"On Wednesday, GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer opened his mouth and inserted his foot so deep that the nation s top doctors will still be trying to remove it when he inevitably loses his next election in a landslide. According to Cramer, Sean Spicer was kinda right when he presented some  alternative facts  regarding the Holocaust   specifically, his claim that Adolf Hitler didn t use chemical weapons (not even in concentration camps or, as Spicer calls them,  Holocaust centers. The media is so gullible, they fall for these things because they think it s really hot stuff and the public just can t wait to stick it to Sean Spicer   who 99% of the people wouldn t have the foggiest idea who he is and it distracts them from other things,  Cramer told conservative radio North Dakota radio host Scott Hennen.  I can t even believe that anybody in the media, much less all of the major networks, led with this story. A spokesperson, who by the way made a poor illustration, but it s not completely, it s not without some validity. I think he apologized and that s the end of it, Cramer said, as though denying the Holocaust can be fixed with a fauxpology.  I think what he was saying is that Hitler didn t take chemical weapons out in a battle-like form and do what Assad did with these children. It s a factual statement,  Cramer says.What Spicer actually said was that Adolf Hitler didn t use chemical weapons, which makes him better than Assad: We didn t use chemical weapons in World War II. You had a, someone who is as despicable as Hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons. He later explained that he acknowledges that Hitler took Jewish people to  Holocaust centers  but that Hitler was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing. How are people responding to this? Well, let s just say that the  Sean Spicer was right that Hitler was a good dude compared to Assad  strategy isn t working out for him:North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer is a full blown idiot. Or a Nazi. Or both.  Pinder Binder (@PinderBinder) April 13, 2017Me: I don't think anyone can top Sean Spicer.Kevin Cramer: hold my be .Me: NO!

 Bernie Sanders: Trump’s Dreams Of A Second Term Will Go Up In Smoke,"Sen. Bernie Sanders says that he doesn t think it s likely that Donald Trump will be reelected to a second term now that the American people have had a chance to see what he s really about. Speaking in New York, the Vermont Senator said he thinks that Trump will be a one-term president. In terms of the first three months in office, Donald Trump is the least popular president in the history of polling,  Sanders said. I do not believe that if Trump continues these policies that he s going to be reelected. Nor do I think that the Republicans are going to do well in 2018. Sanders explained that a wave of progressivism has taken hold and is sweeping across the country. This, he added, does not bode well for conservatives. The momentum right now is with the progressive movement in this country,  Sanders said.  And I think the Republicans are on the defensive and will be on the defensive increasingly. The senator offered up Tuesday s special election in Kansas to replace now-CIA Director Mike Pompeo as an example of this trend. Although it was a deep red district that Trump won hands down in the presidential election, Republican candidate Ron Estes just barely managed to scrape by with a narrow win over civil rights attorney James Thompson (D). The Republicans had to spend money like crazy at the end to beat him,  Sanders said.  I think that s a very good omen for the future. Judging by the way the beginning of Trump s presidency has gone, you have to wonder if Trump will even get the chance to run for reelection.

 WATCH: Reporter Calls Kellyanne Conway And Her Lies ‘The Darkness’ – Her Reply Is INSANELY Ironic,"Everyone knows by now just how fast and loose Kellyanne Conway is with her words. She pioneered  alternative facts.  She claimed that the U.S. had never gone as long without a Treasury Secretary as we did with Trump. She made up an entire terrorist attack. She said that microwaves turn into cameras. And somehow, people still want to talk to her.Some in the press have started seeing her as  the darkness,  because she s such a purveyor of misinformation. That word,  darkness,  refers to the Washington Post s front page motto,  Democracy dies in darkness.  Michael Wolff, a reporter for the Hollywood Reporter, told her: I m going to tell you, when they say  democracy dies in darkness,  you re the darkness. So the Washington Post (and Wolff) is calling her and other purveyors of lies out in their front-page motto. Conway s response was to first say,  I m not the darkness! Then she said: It s what I tell small children: Just because somebody says something doesn t make it true, and it s a great lesson for everyone. Miss Bowling Green Massacre is defending herself against accusations of lies by pointing out that people lie. The irony! It hurts! But it gets even better: You can turn on the TV   more than you can read in the paper because I assume editors are still doing their jobs in most places   and people literally say things that just aren t true. Yes, primarily Fox News and those that like Trump. And herself. Someone needs to get Glass House here to say all of this again while looking in a mirror.Watch below:.@MichaelWolffNYC:  Democracy dies in darkness.

 Republican Compares Lincoln To Hitler; This Time It Wasn’t Sean Spicer,"Whitewashing Hitler and the Holocaust seems to be all the rage among today s Republicans. There was the time when the White House remembered the Holocaust on Holocaust Remembrance Day, but forgot to mention the Jews, at all. Yesterday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Hitler didn t use chemical weapons. He s been trying, and failing, at backtracking ever since. Now, a Republican in North Carolina, on his Facebook page, compared Abraham Lincoln to Hitler.It was a comment by GOP Legislator Larry Pittman. He posted his newsletter on Facebook, and among the rest of the hate, he commented this to a person telling him to  get over  the Supreme Court ruling that made same-sex marriage the law of the land (something he hopes to overturn, at the state level):And if Hitler had won, should the world just get over it? Lincoln was the same sort if tyrant, and personally responsible for the deaths of over 800,000 Americans in a war that was unnecessary and unconstitutional.Obviously, his followers let him have it, but perhaps the best answer was this one:The Civil War was unnecessary and unconstitutional? What on earth were you thinking? The Republican Party used to be   proudly   called the Party of Lincoln. I have no idea what to call it now, at least that could be repeated in polite company.Couldn t NC Rep #LarryPittman find someone else to compare #Hitler to rather than #Lincoln ? @maddow #ncpol https://t.co/4sjhsCHPOs pic.twitter.com/LLSQv6y47q  Indy Week (@indyweek) April 12, 2017Pittman clearly has no idea whatsoever what the Constitution says or he would not be putting forth a bill that would try to nullify federal law. That is against the Constitution. Now, so is slavery, although I m sure that s something else Pittman would like to nullify.Racism is nothing new for Pittman. Like Donald Trump, he was a birther. He said this about President Obama: Someone had posted something [on Facebook] with a picture of Barack Obama and across it said  traitor,    Pittman said.  And, you know, I don t always agree with the guy, I certainly didn t vote for him but I gotta defend him on this one. I just don t think it s right at all to call Barack Obama a traitor. There s a lot of things he s done wrong but he is not a traitor. Not as far as I can tell. I haven t come across any evidence yet that he has done one thing to harm Kenya.

 WATCH: Trump’s Attorney Flat-Out ADMITS Trump Admin Just Too Intellectually Lazy To Study Facts,"Trump s Syrian policy is all over the place, to the point where The Economist actually published a story saying,  Wanted: a coherent Syria policy.  Trump s position was  let Syria handle its own problems,  right up until Assad dropped sarin gas on his people. It wasn t until the images of poisoned children started coming in that he decided we needed to respond. Why?Trump s attorney, Michael Cohen, appeared on CNN with Chris Cuomo to discuss President Flip-Flop s new Syria policy. Cuomo asked why Trump would shift from a hands-off-Syria policy to an intervene-now policy, and Cohen s response was downright frightening: When we were watching, whether it was here on CNN or any of the other stations, the Syrian refugees that were leaving, they weren t the young. They weren t the aged. They weren t women. They were all these 19 to 25-year-old men that when they were walking to these makeshift homes in Germany that they put up for them, it looked like a military operation. Cuomo responded by saying that those videos were selective, and the numbers and facts painted a very different picture of the refugees coming out of Syria.  Yes, you have young men, but those refugees are the same people that the president is saying he cares so much about. Cuomo is referring to the sheer hypocrisy of this administration s current Syria policy: Assad is gassed his own people, including women and children, but Trump doesn t want to accept the refugees Assad s regime creates. Unfortunately, that didn t sway Cohen, who doubled down on the idea that misleading videos are more reliable than data and facts:CUOMO: Yeah, the question is, why were people picking those videos? Was it misleading? The data would say yes.COHEN: But maybe it wasn t misleading. Maybe it was more of the reality, what was going on.CUOMO: No, but the numbers, Michael, say it s not the reality.COHEN: Again, I don t want to start talking about numbers. Numbers have not proven to suit me well.And there it is: Cohen and Trump and probably a large chunk of the entire administration is too intellectually lazy to try and understand facts and data.Watch the full exchange below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"April 12, 2017"
 Trump Campaign Manager Registering As Foreign Agent After Lobbying For Russian Interests,"Donald Trump s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, is now retroactively registering as a foreign agent   the new term for  traitor,  apparently   after the water got a bit too hot with regard to his lobbying efforts on behalf of a pro-Putin Ukranian party.BREAKING: Spokesman says former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is registering with US gov't as foreign agent.  The Associated Press (@AP) April 12, 2017According to a Manafort spokesman his work on behalf of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine which sought to promote Vladimir Putin s agenda in Washington, began before he joined the Trump campaign, though it is not clear if The Donald knew about this when he hired him. Of course, it is unlikely that The Donald would have cared given his response to Michael Flynn s work on behalf of foreign powers (he kept Flynn around until he was practically forced to get rid of him). The Associated Press reports:A Washington lobbying firm that worked under the direction of two former Trump campaign advisers has registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. The firm said its work could have benefited the Ukrainian government.The Podesta Group s cited details of lobbying it performed from 2012 through 2014 on behalf of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine. The firm reported being paid more than $1.2 million for the effort.The disclosure follows reporting by the AP in August that the firm of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, who served in a senior role in the Trump campaign, had overseen the lobbying effort. The effort sought to promote a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party s interests in Washington.This is now the second person associated with Donald Trump s team who has retroactively registered as a foreign agent.Something is rotten in the state of Denmark err, the United States.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 12, 2017"
 Trump Surrogate: Carter Page Being A Russian Agent Isn’t Evidence Of ‘Collusion’ (VIDEO),"If you haven t heard, former Trump advisor Carter Page was the subject of a successfully-executed FISA warrant because of his dealings with Russia. Former FBI agent Asha Rangappa notes that the bar to obtain a warrant is extremely high and that the process of obtaining one  includes too many layers of approval to be granted without strong evidence.  Nevertheless, Trump and his associates continue to complain that members of his campaign and administration became the subject of investigations because of their illegal activity.On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that Page became the focus of an investigation because a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge was thoroughly convinced that there was  probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia. Appearing on CNN, braindead Trump lemming Kayleigh McEnany worked hard to dispel any idea that Page colluding with Russia is evidence that members of the campaign colluding with Russia. I don t think it s evidence of the Trump campaign colluding with Russia at all,  she said.  He was a brief adviser on the campaign, and the campaign [was] trying to distance themselves from him.  In reality, Page was one of the first foreign policy advisors Trump named. But look, I don t think we have any evidence to suggest that President Trump knew that this guy was a foreign agent, and he wanted him on his campaign because he wanted to collude with Russia,  he said.  That is another step that you have to make, and I don t think there are facts there to show that. Here s the thing: whether or not Trump knew is a nonissue. When Trump was warned about Michael Flynn s shady dealing with Russia, he brushed it off and kept the disgraced General on as national security advisor. He even fired the person who warned him. It would not have mattered to Trump if he knew about Page, because for some reason it s cool to work with Russia under President* Trump.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 12, 2017"
 Trump Attacks James Comey For Not Jailing Clinton: ‘She Was Guilty Of Every Charge’ (VIDEO),"In an interview with Fox Business that aired Tuesday, Donald Trump responded to news that the FBI had successfully obtained a FISA warrant to look into his former advisor Carter Page by trashing James Comey for not locking Hillary Clinton up. Sure, Clinton did not commit any crimes and was never charged with anything, but according to Trump she is GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY. When Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton. He saved her life, Trump said, apparently forgetting that a certain letter from Comey helped swing the election his way. When he was reading those charges, she was guilty of every charge, and then he said she was essentially OK. Nevertheless, for some reason Trump says he trusts Comey to clear him with regard to Russia.Trump also complained that he is understaffed because of  obstructionist  Democrats and other things that prevent him from accomplishing what he wants   like  the law.  In reality, the problem is that The Donald isn t actually nominating people. Democrats have only  obstructed  when there was a legitimate objection, like that the person worked with Russia or is a white supremacist.Trump told Fox that he still believes he was correct when he accused President Obama of  tapping  his  wires  at Trump Tower because numerous members of his administration were and are under investigation by the FBI for their illegal activities (many involving Russia). While it is true that Trump Tower was monitored years ago, it had more to do with the Russian money laundering operation that was happening three floors below Trump s penthouse than anything else. Over 30 Russian mobsters were indicted as a result of the investigation.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 12, 2017"
 Trump Brags About The ‘Beautiful Chocolate Cake’ He Was Eating When He Attacked Syria (VIDEO),"Trump, channeling Marie Antoinette, decided to share how he spent the moments leading up to committing an act of war against Syria: He was in Mar-a-Lago s dining room eating  the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake. True to form, Trump couldn t help but brag about the quality of dessert he was eating while relaying his war story to Fox s Maria Bartiromo who got an exclusive sit down with Trump to talk about his impulsive decision to take the country to the brink of war.Trump, who advocates cutting food programs for disadvantaged school children, thought America would want to know how great the Mar-a-Lago cakes are. I was sitting at the table, we had finished eating, we were now having dessert. And we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you ve ever had. Words failing him, Trump outstretched his hands and gave an approximate size. Since he s a big boy and was behaving well at dinner, Trump got an extra bigly slice of chocolate cake. He was also quick to note that the President of China loved the chocolate cake. It s now been 30 seconds since he was asked to describe his order to attack Syria. He hadn t mentioned the country once.In fact, when Trump gets around to describing the country he just attacked he calls it Iraq. Maria quickly clarifies that he means Syria.At least he got the flavor of cake right, if not the country, right?Trump says he told President Xi about US missile strikes in Syria over  the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake  pic.twitter.com/CTKtXBl9nI  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) April 12, 2017Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 12, 2017"
" FBI Releases DAMNING Information About Russian Collusion, Trump TERRIFIED","The Washington Post reported Tuesday that former Trump advisor Carter Page was one of the members of the Trump campaign who were monitored by the FBI because of their communications with Russia. As part of an investigation into the campaign that long predates Director James Comey s infamous  Clinton email  letter that helped swing the election in Donald Trump s favor, a judge granted the Bureau s request   a decision that is not made lightly:The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials.This is the clearest evidence so far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents. Such contacts are now at the center of an investigation into whether the campaign coordinated with the Russian government to swing the election in Trump s favor.Page says that the real story isn t the fire   it s that people reported the fire. This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified, politically motivated government surveillance,  Page told the Post, failing to mention that a judge would not have granted the warrant if there was not already convincing evidence it was necessary.  I have nothing to hide. Ever since his administration began leaking like a colander, Trump and his crew have been working overtime to convince the American people that the information itself is unimportant (no matter how important it is), that the real problem is that someone is telling us about it. Page, of course, is no exception.The FBI officials did not reveal if the investigation uncovered evidence of a crime, but Page and the rest of the crew are acting very, very guilty.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"April 12, 2017"
 New York Daily News Cover SAVAGES White House For Spicer’s Hitler Gaffe (IMAGE),"The New York Daily News is not known for subtlety when it comes to its covers. The snarky newspaper pulled no punches when it came to using its cover to go after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for calling concentration camps  Holocaust Centers  and invoking Nazi butcher Adolf Hitler when talking about Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Wednesday morning s cover reads: Nazis murdered 2.7 million Jews, gassing 6,000 a day in Auschwtiz alone FORGOTTEN BY WHITE HOUSE Here is the image of that cover via New York Daily News Twitter:Of course, The New York Daily News isn t the first to go after Spicer for these remarks. The Anne Frank Center has called on Donald Trump to fire Spicer, as has House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Further, this is part of a disturbing pattern of anti-Semitism from Team Trump. During the campaign he regularly retweeted white supremacists, most infamously when he tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton over a pile of money with a Star of David that said,  Most Corrupt Candidate Ever.  This tweet caused such an uproar that House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced to speak out about it. After he was elected, Trump s White House deliberately left any mention of Jewish people out of their Holocaust Remembrance Day statement. And, of course, no one can forget that we have avowed white supremacists working in the West Wing.To that end, if this administration doesn t want to be called bigots, they need to stop acting like it. Get rid of the racists, homophobes, xenophobes, and other assorted overtly bigoted people.Don t hold your breath on that one, though. We ll have four years of this kind of stuff. The only silver lining may be that in the end, the GOP can no longer say that they don t traffic in bigotry, since it s right there in the White House for all to see, while their party is in charge.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 12, 2017"
 Chelsea Clinton Has A Little Advice For Sean Spicer After He Defends Hitler,"White House Secretary Sean Spicer decided to rewrite history on Tuesday, arguing that Adolf Hitler wasn t such a bad guy after all because he didn t use chemical weapons like Assad. While most of us were facepalming and shouting  gas chambers,  Chelsea Clinton stepped forward with a classy tweet offering Spicey a little advice. I hope @PressSec takes time to visit @HolocaustMuseum,  the former first daughter tweeted this afternoon.  It s a few blocks away,  she added helpfully.I hope @PressSec takes time to visit @HolocaustMuseum. It s a few blocks away. https://t.co/24fNoMUyS8  Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) April 11, 2017Spicer made his humiliating comments on Tuesday, which also happens to be the day Jews are celebrating the Passover seder. He was trying to convince the world that Donald Trump was right to bomb Syria but only ended up proving that he s a total idiot.When Spicer was called out on his ridiculous assertion that Hitler didn t gas millions of people in concentration camps, he grabbed a shovel and dug his hole deeper. Passing the point of no return, the press secretary argued that Hitler didn t gas his own people, just the Jews. And apparently, they don t count.Everybody except Trump s loyal base of anti-Semitic holocaust deniers knows that Spicer s version of history is a long, long way from the truth and it may be the worst excuse ever used to justify military action.People are justifiably outraged. The Anne Frank Center issued a statement calling for Spicer s resignation.  Spicer s statement is the most evil slur upon a group of people we have ever heard from a White House press secretary,   said Steven Goldstein, the organization s executive director.  Sean Spicer now lacks the integrity to serve  and  President Trump must fire him at once,  he added.Spicer would be wise to take Clinton s advice and study up a little on the holocaust before the next time he decides to spout off about what a swell guy Hitler was.Featured image via Marcus Ingram/Getty Images",News,"April 11, 2017"
 New Trump Comments Confirm That Bannon Could Be On His Way OUT (DETAILS),"There have been weeks of reports that White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Senior Adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner have been at each other s throats. Reportedly, the infighting is so bad that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had to moderate a meeting between the two so that they could call a truce. Now, new comments from Donald Trump suggest that he s not so hot on Bannon these days, and if it comes down to it in a knock down, drag out, Bannon v. Kushner fight, Kushner will definitely emerge the victor.Michael Goodwin of the New York Post asked Donald Trump if he was still confident in Bannon s abilities, and for the first time, Trump didn t give a full-throated defense of his white supremacist Chief Strategist. In fact, he seemed to want to downplay the level of Bannon s influence in both the campaign and the White House. Trump told Goodwin: I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late. I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn t know Steve. I m my own strategist and it wasn t like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary. When White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked about the Bannon v. Kushner feud, he tried to say that the media was making too much of it: There s a lot of stuff that was overblown about this that makes it out into the media sometimes and gets a little more sensational than it really is. Of course, this directly contradicts Trump s comments to the New York Post. In addition to the aforementioned statements, Trump also said: Steve is a good guy, but I told them to straighten it out or I will. So, in other words, it looks like Bannon is on the chopping block. Perhaps the rest of the white nationalist Pepe brigade will be ousted with him if and when he goes. It s a shame that we have sunk to the level in 2017 of hoping to get avowed white supremacists out of the White House, but here we are.

 Those Intel Reports That Nunes Ran To Trump With Reveal A BOMBSHELL That Trump Will HATE,"Remember the House Intelligence Committee s investigation into the Trump-Russia connection, and how Chairman Devin Nunes compromised it by running to Trump with documents he should have shown to his fellow committee members first? And how he then had to recuse himself from the investigation for all of that? It seems that those documents do, in fact, contain a bombshell, but it s not the one that Trump insisted we d find.House Republicans and Democrats have completed their review of those documents, and they demonstrate that nobody in the Obama administration wiretapped Trump at any time, nor did they do anything unusual, let alone illegal, with foreign surveillance. Even the  scandal  that Republicans tried to create around Susan Rice s request to unmask certain members of Trump s campaign turned out to be a big ol  nothingburger.One particular Congressional source said that Rice s requests were both normal and appropriate, and another said that there are  absolutely  no smoking guns present that demonstrate Rice and Obama did anything wrong. This vindicates Rice s assertions that her requests were normal: There were occasions when I would receive a report in which a US person was referred to   name not provided, just a US person   and sometimes in that context, in order to understand the importance of the report, and assess its significance, it was necessary to find out, or request the information as to who the US official was.The notion that some people are trying to suggest, is that by asking for the identity of a person is leaking it, is unequivocally false. There is no connection between unmasking and leaking. Trump isn t going to like this. It makes him look like a bigger paranoid, narcissistic moron than ever over these tweets:Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Is it legal for a sitting President to be  wire tapping  a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!  Donald J.

When he was asked whether he thought Rice acted illegally, he said,  Do I think? Yes, I think. He also said: I think it s going to be the biggest story. It s such an important story for our country and the world. Nunes looks like an idiot too, and now should probably resign his chairmanship. If Trump says anything, expect him to double down on his accusations.

 Stephen King Tweets ULTIMATE Sean Spicer Insult That Is Pretty Goddamn Funny (TWEET),"Just when you thought you ve heard the ultimate insult being hurled at Sean Spicer for being Donald Trump s fall guy and practically the dumbest person on the planet, legendary author Stephen King steps up and knocks one out of the park.As you ve likely heard by now, unless you live in a cave or something, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer pretty much denied the existence of the Holocaust by making the ridiculous statement that Syrian President Assad is worse than Adolf Hitler, because at least Hitler didn t gas people. And as you probably well know, and if you don t, shame on you, Jewish concentration camps under Hitler s Nazi regime murdered millions of Jews in gas chambers.Witnessing this stupidity alongside the rest of America and the world was Stephen King who then went after Spicer, as one should, for being so remarkably dumb.King tweeted out: If donuts were awarded for dumb, Sean Spicer would have his own Krispy Kreme franchise.

 Spicer Has Epic Freudian Slip During His Half-Assed Apology For Hitler Comments (VIDEO),"Sean Spicer s is having a very, very bad day.While the Jewish community celebrated Passover, Spicer claimed that Adolf Hitler never gassed people. After immediate backlash, Spicer said he meant Hitler never gassed German citizens. After another immediate backlash, Spicer said he meant Hitler never specifically bombed people with chemical weapons, merely gassed them in concentration camps (which he bizarrely called  holocaust centers ). By this point, he had proven his original point was nonsensical and still offensive, while also proving that he was a bad liar.It would take him a few more hours   and a call from the Israeli government asking that he resign  before he got around to begrudgingly apologizing. And he managed to screw that up too.While speaking with CNN s Wolf Blitzer, Spicer claimed he didn t want his Hitler comments to be a  distraction  from Trump s efforts. What efforts exactly? Allow Spicer, seen here stepping on every metaphorical rake in the yard, to explain with characteristic rambling, jumbled sentences:I needed to make sure I clarified and not in any way, shape or form any more of a distraction from the president s decisive action in Syria and the attempts that he s making to destabilize the region.Sean accidentally just said the quiet part loud.

Trump s son Eric would clear things up when he openly admitted Trump impulsively decided to issue the strike after his daughter Ivanka asked him to.Instead, Trump s Middle Eastern efforts continue to be haphazard and counterproductive.

 Dan Rather Says What Every Person With A Moral Compass Is Thinking Regarding Sean Spicer & Trump,"It s gotten to the point where if Donald Trump doesn t fire Sean Spicer for his egregious remarks about the Holocaust, Assad and Syria, he should be seen as agreeing with Spicer s sentiment as well as condoning it.It s disgusting, to say the least, and the legendary Dan Rather just released a statement that should summarize what every person with a decent moral compass is thinking right now.Rather wrote: It is with sadness that I do not know where to begin. Today in a briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer issued a statement that is so far beyond the pale, so tone deaf and blind to history and our precarious moment in world affairs, that it is with only a heavy heart that I even bring attention to it. There can be no joy in such incompetence.In trying to make the case for the Administration s policy in Syria and vis a vis Russia which is confused to be generous, and wildly chaotic to be more precise, Mr. Spicer said,  We didn t use chemical weapons in World War II. You know, you had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons.  He continued,  So you have to, if you are Russia, ask yourself: Is this a country and a regime that you want to align yourself with?  When asked to clarify, Mr. Spicer said,  I think when you come to sarin gas, he (Hitler) was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing.  Mr. Spicer went on to mention  Holocaust centers,  in an apparent reference to the Nazi concentration camps.This line of rhetoric is so unhinged, so amateurish, so lacking in the context and perspective necessary for statesmanship and diplomacy that I do not see how Mr. Spicer can be allowed to continue in his current position. But in the end, this is less about him and more about an Administration that is inserting itself in a civil war and now is plunging into a drastic reformulation of American foreign policy without any clear sense that they have a plan. When you try to explain such a situation, it is understandable that your words don t make sense.A bar, already set low, continues to drop. If Trump doesn t fire Spicer then he is fully condoning Holocaust denial within his administration. This shouldn t only outrage America, but cause a massive resistance against the current administration that has never been seen before. This must not be condoned or accepted. It is not okay.Featured Photo by Kirk Irwin/Getty Images for SiriusXM",News,"April 11, 2017"
 Jeff Sessions’ Written Immigration Speech Puts His REVOLTING Beliefs About Immigrants On Display,"The Trump administration is working as hard as it can to fulfill its promise of cracking down on illegal immigration, and part of that promise was, more or less, to be as evil as possible so they won t even want to come over here. Now, Jeff Sessions is starting to work on putting this into practice, including pushing for more severe prosecutions and punishments, even for non-violent immigrants.But it s not what he s doing that s so horrid. It s horrid, but not nearly as much so as what he planned to called them in a speech to Border Patrol agents in Nogales. His planned remarks included this vile portion: It is here, on this sliver of land, where we first take our stand against this filth.This is a new era. This is the Trump era. Now, that supposedly was referring only to criminal organizations like gangs and cartels. However, many of the people who cross the border illegally are doing so to escape those very organizations   not to expand them into the U.S.He didn t actually say this in his speech in Nogales, but it was in his prepared remarks. The fact that it was even there shows exactly how he sees undocumented immigrants. They re chattel, they re dirty, disgusting animals, and they re any number of things other than human beings to him.Undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than citizens. People like to point to the fact that they make up a large share of inmates in federal prisons, but federal prisons are a small part of the total prison system in the U.S. ICE s recent numbers aren t especially telling, either since their current focus is immigrants with criminal convictions (which is why they re stalking courthouses).Trump once said that undocumented immigrants were rapists and murderers,  and some, I assume, are good people.  Sessions is building upon that view of undocumented immigrants as mostly criminals, and no amount of,  We re talking about criminal organizations  is going to change that until this administration changes its attitude.Featured image by Michael B.

 Anne Frank Center SAVAGES Spicer After He Said Hitler Didn’t Gas Jews At ‘Holocaust Centers’ (TWEETS),"It s no secret that a large percentage of the Trump administration thinks the Holocaust didn t happen (or, if they do, they think Hitler had it right), but even The Donald s harshest critics didn t expect the White House Press Secretary to openly deny the Holocaust during a press briefing. But, of course, this is the Trump administration where up is down, taking food from the poor is  compassionate,  and Hitler didn t gas the Jews.On Tuesday, White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer attempted to defend Trump s seemingly pointless (unless the point was to make himself a whole lot of money through investments in the company that makes the missiles used) bombing run in Syria that he authorized because Ivanka was having a sad day. According to Spicer, Assad is much worse than Hitler becauseat least he didn t use chemical weapons on his people like Syria s president does. We didn t use chemical weapons in World War II. You had a, someone who is as despicable as Hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons,  Spicer told a room full of almost certainly stunned reporters. In other words, Zyklon B didn t exist and concentration camps   Spicer called them  Holocaust centers    were just fun places where stuff happened that totally didn t involve chemical weapons being used on Jewish people.Shortly after Spicer said the Holocaust didn t happen, the Anne Frank Center stepped up to take his words and shove them down his throat with such force that they traveled through time and shot out the seat of his great grandson s pants in the middle of his Speech final. (He ran out of the room and received an  Incomplete )..@POTUS @realDonaldTrump MUST FIRE SEAN SPICER NOW FOR ENGAGING IN HOLOCAUST DENIAL. OUR STATEMENT BELOW. #Antisemitism #NeverAgain pic.twitter.com/4dB9ESCaZr  AnneFrankCenter(US) (@AnneFrankCenter) April 11, 2017 On Passover no less, Sean Spicer has engaged in Holocaust denial, the most offensive form of fake news imaginable, by denying Hitler gassed millions of Jews to death,  the organization s executive director, Steven Goldstein, said in a statement.  Spicer s statement is the most evil slur upon a group of people we have ever heard from a White House press secretary. Sean Spicer now lacks the integrity to serve  and  President Trump must fire him at once, Goldstein says.Though many would disagree with the idea that Spicer had integrity at all at any point in his life, the sentiment is true: Spicer must resign, or Trump must fire him. Or there will be hell to pay.Watch Spicer s remarks below, and happy Genocide Awareness and Prevention Month, everyone!Here s Spicer s answer about Hitler not using chemical weapons (he gassed millions), and his attempt at a clarification, which made it worse pic.twitter.com/gcJGhASVK2  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) April 11, 2017Spicer, trying to clarify his Hitler answer makes it worse:  He was not using the gas on his own people in the same way that Assad is doing  pic.twitter.com/SSA1P680z5  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) April 11, 2017Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 11, 2017"
" Trump White House Is About To Screw Up Easter For 1,000s Of Little Children","If you re keeping track, so far, Donald Trump has screwed up two military missions, his plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, his tax plan, and now, Easter.Just days before Christians  most holy day, the Trump White House still is not preoared for the annual easter egg hunt on the White House lawn. While this is symbolic, it s a big symbol.The Sunday tradition is 138 years old, and as Melinda Bates, the Easter event organizer behind President Bill Clinton s eight times as host, told The New York Times,  It s the single most high-profile event that takes place at the White House each year, and the White House and the first lady are judged on how well they put it on.  From her perspective, the outcome of the event is an indication of the administration s inner workings.Source: SalonFor this we can blame the First Lady   no, not the First Daughter First Lady   Melania. First Ladies have a job in this country and the Easter Egg hunt is one of them. Her refusal to leave her comfy home in Manhattan means thousands of children, including children of military personnel, could go without a favorite Easter pasttime.Some even took to reaching out to the FLOTUS on the one place they know they can find her husband: Twitter:@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @MELANIATRUMP @IvankaTrump FYI manufacturing deadlines for the Easter eggs are near. Please reach out! pic.twitter.com/D78YqWVPBi  Wells Wood Turning (@WellsTurning) February 20, 2017This event is actually pretty huge. About 4,000 school children receive tickets every year and about 3,000 children of military familes. They may all be disappointed. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has not reached out about it,  Ashley Broadway-Mack, the president of the American Military Partner Association told the Times. Congress members have also not been contacted about tickets for their constituents.Because of this, the event has been cut in half and they ll only have about 1/5th of the security, and it s all because the First Lady has been neglegent in even staffing her office. She named a chief of staff and social secretary in early February but has yet to announce a director for the Visitors Office, normally the crucial player in the daunting execution of the event,  the Times reported.The vacant positions are cause for concern, according to Bates.  I m really concerned for the Trump people. This thing is all hands on deck. In her defense, this is all par for the course for the Trump administration, whose motto just seems to be  wing it and hope things don t get too screwed up.

 Sean Spicer Claims Hitler Never Gassed People In Outrageous Defense Of Syrian Bombing (VIDEO),"Sean Spicer s time as press secretary has been a particularly humiliating one. Each time he goes up to the podium, he lies or fumbles. And today, he reached a particularly pathetic low point when he seemingly erased the holocaust from history with a single outrageous claim. The timing was especially bad as Trump s administration dodges accusations of anti-Semitism and the Jewish community celebrates the holiday of the Passover seder.According to Spicer s version of events, Hitler never gassed people.WATCH: Sean Spicer: ""You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons."" pic.twitter.com/WdI6bu1wJj  Yashar (@yashar) April 11, 2017Spicer comment came while he hamfistedly attempted to justify bombing Syria because of the Assad regime s use of chemical weapons. In an effort to prove his point, Spicer claimed Hitler   perpetrator of the worst mass murder in history   never used chemical weapons because he found them so immoral. Undoubtedly Spicer was referring to the fact that Hitler was said to have opposed chemical weapons on the battlefield because of his experience being gassed in World War I. However, Hitler and the Nazi party had absolutely no qualms with gassing their victims in the concentration camps, which they did on an industrial scale. (In fact, the idea that Hitler was gassed in WWI is actually suspected by historians to be a lie invented by Hitler himself to cover for his long history of mental illness. Passing along this myth is perpetuating an artful piece of propaganda invented by Hitler. Nice going, Spicey.)To suggest that Hitler wouldn t  sink to using chemical weapons  is an outrageous way of dehumanizing those who died in the holocaust. For him to say this while standing at the podium at the White House is sickening. More hypocritically, Trump himself praised the use of chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein as recently as last summer, suggesting they allowed him to keep his enemies in line. His bombing of Syria came as a shock precisely because he has shown absolutely zero interest in preventing chemical warfare up until this point. Disturbingly, the United States has a sordid history with chemical weapons stockpiles dating back to the first World War. It was not until the 1990s that the U.S. firmly committed to getting rid of them.Asked for clarification, Spicer then tried to make a distinction between Jews and Germans. Gassing the Jewish people in concentration camps is different than gassing  your own people.  Another defense that neo-Nazis continue to use to this day. The hole Spicer is digging keeps getting deeper.Press Sec. on Hitler/Assad comments: ""He was not using the gas on his own people the same way he brought them into the Holocaust centers."" pic.twitter.com/mO9EsWM4QT  ABC News (@ABC) April 11, 2017Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 11, 2017"
 United Just Took A DISGUSTING Step To Smear The Victim At The Heart Of Viral PR Disaster,"United Airlines is in an economic and pulic relations tailspin after they were caught on tape brutally dragging a passenger from a plane after he refused to leave. The man, David Dao, is a doctor, and he was left bloody when he was physically forced to disembark because the plane was overbooked. Now, United is taking a page straight from the GOP playbook and using the media to trash Dr. Dao s past.This article appeared today in Kentucky s Courier-Journal and is making its rounds throughout the media. Apparently, according to the paper, the doctor has a  troubled past,  as if that has anything at all to do with Monday s horrific incident.Dao, who went to medical school in Vietnam in the 1970s before moving to the U.S., was working as a pulmonologist in Elizabethtown when he was arrested in 2003 and eventually convicted of drug-related offenses after an undercover investigation, according to documents filed with the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure last June. The documents allege that he was involved in fraudulent prescriptions for controlled substances and was sexually involved with a patient who used to work for his practice and assisted police in building a case against him.Dao was convicted of multiple felony counts of obtaining drugs by fraud or deceit in November 2004 and was placed on five years of supervised probation in January 2005. He surrendered his medical license the next month.Who cares?Victim blaming is nothing new. Every woman who has ever been assaulted knows all about it. Republicans and Fox News have turned it into an art form.We ve seen it before. They blamed Trayvon Martin for his death. Hell, they blame every African-American who dies the hands of cops (and wannabe cops).Fox even (of course they do) blames the victims of their own predators. They victim blamed a woman who dared speak out on behalf of all women. The right even blames victims of gun violence for not being armed.Now, we don t know for sure that United (or the Chicago Police Department, who actually did the dragging) planted the story in the media, but it s a pretty reasonable guess, especially after United s CEO, Oscar Munoz, trashed the victim in a letter to his staff.The bottom line is that it shouldn t and doesn t matter what the doctor did 10 years ago. Unless he is an escaped convict, he has the same rights as anyone else on that plane.Featured image via video screen capture.",News,"April 11, 2017"
 Eric Trump Accidentally Exposes Who Was Behind Syria Strike And The Whole Trump Family’s In Trouble,"Eric Trump sat down with the Telegraph and things quickly went off the rails. Eric  for years seen as the dumb one    blundered his way through the interview with such lack of self-awareness that he wound up revealing a bunch of stuff he shouldn t have. But there is one tone-deaf comment that Eric Trump made that you ll want to keep in the back of your mind throughout the rest of this story. When asked about his father s desire to make the White House a Trump family affair, Eric said: Is that nepotism? Absolutely. Is that also a beautiful thing? Absolutely. Family business is a beautiful thing. A lot of ink has been spilled speculating on what Trump s presidential  doctrine  is, but the answer is painfully simple: Rank nepotism. Paranoid and alienated, Trump s only allies in Washington are his own children and he s been furthering his separation from the rest of his staff by leaning on them with increasing regularity. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner has recently become the most powerful person in the country. His only qualification is getting married to Ivanka.Unfortunately, it gets worse. Donald Trump isn t just placing his close family and friends in positions they have no business being in, but also allowing those inexperienced cronies the chance to influence American military operations. According to Eric, his sister Ivanka was actually the architect of the decision to bomb Syria. Until January 20, Ivanka s career was in selling cheap jewelry made in China to fans of her father s reality tv show. She now has a seat at the table in starting a world war.[Eric] confirmed that President Trump s decision to bomb a Syrian airbase to punish President Bashar al-Assad for a nerve gas attack last week was influenced by the reaction of his sister Ivanka, who said she was  heartbroken and outraged  by the atrocity.That he was listening to his daughter and not his advisers explains why the Trump White House seemed chaotic and clueless in the hours after the bombing. Nobody was on the same page. Trump s UN ambassador and his Secretary of State were issuing conflicting statements about the intent of the bombings. Other staff initially bragged about destroying the airfield. Trump contradicted them by saying he intentionally didn t destroy the airfield. Nobody knew what was going on   except maybe Ivanka, a person with no official job in the White House.Adding to the confusion, Trump himself once praised Saddam Hussein for using chemical weapons on his enemies. It was jarring to watch him claim that Assad s use of sarin gas was so personally offensive to him that he had to go to war. Eric s confession that it was Ivanka s decision fills in a lot of blanks.The fact that Eric would freely admit that this is how the White House is being run goes back to his observation that nepotism is  beautiful.  Living all his life in the shadow of his dad, it seems as though he and his siblings aren t aware of how gross this whole thing is. They are second-generation silver spooners. Their dad owes his success to their grandfather. They are so far removed from the real world that they ve forgotten they never earned anything.And they are running the country. Together.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 11, 2017"
 What This Poll Says About Bernie Sanders And Republicans Should TERRIFY The GOP,"Senator Bernie Sanders is the most popular senator in the United States and a new poll proves it. The latest Morning Consult poll to come out has found that, out of all the lawmakers serving in the United States Senate, the Vermont senator has the highest approval ratings among his constituents.The poll revealed that a whopping 75 percent of Sanders  constituents approve of his performance. Only 21 percent of Vermont residents who were polled disapprove of the senator.In contrast to the glowing endorsements Sanders received from his constituents, Mitch McConnell had the lowest approval rating of any U.S. senator. A measly 44 percent of the Kentucky lawmaker s constituents approved of his performance in office, while 47 percent disapproved of him. McConnell has earned himself a special achievement, being the only senator to have more of his constituents disapprove of his performance than approve.Sanders and McConnell were also voted the most liked and least liked, respectively, in September of 2016 and have held on to their titles since then.The runners up for the least liked were Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) who came in second with a disapproval rating of 43 percent and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) who was in third place at 40 percent.According to the Morning Consult website, more than 85,000 registered voters were included in  weekly online national polling from January 2017 through March 2017 to determine the latest Senator & Governor Approval Rankings.  In each poll, they were asked whether they approved or disapproved of the senator in question and were then asked a series of questions about his/her performance that they could answer with  strongly approve, somewhat approve, somewhat disapprove, strongly disapprove, or don t know / no opinion. This poll does not account for the fact that Bernie Sanders is loved far and wide, not just in Vermont. After building one heck of a movement during the Democratic presidential primaries, he has remained a powerful voice in politics and maintains a loyal following across the country.Featured image via Scott Eisen/Getty Images",News,"April 11, 2017"
 WATCH Bill O’Reilly Get INSANELY Vile Over Bloodied United Passenger – It’s SICK Even For Him,"We ve been abuzz all day about a doctor who was forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight at Chicago s O Hare International Airport. Chicago Department of Aviation police yanked him out of his seat so hard his face hit the armrest and he ended up in the hospital. Most people who have any kind of a conscience are outraged, as well they should be, because there are a zillion things wrong with this scenario.Bill O Reilly, on the other hand, doesn t seem to be all that outraged over it. His reaction was positively disgusting. Seriously. After showing the video, he literally laughed. Then he said: I shouldn t be laughing but it s just so bizarre. Good lord, does the man have any decency at all? Oh, wait, we know the answer to that already. Yes, it s bizarre, but not in a way that warrants laughing. How black does your soul have to be to laugh at something like this? Watch below:United had oversold this particular flight and was having trouble getting people to voluntarily give up their seats so they could get a flight crew to Louisville. With no volunteers, they randomly selected four people to be bumped, and this doctor was one of them. He refused to give up his seat, so United called Dept. of Aviation police to get rid of him.And O Reilly finds it funny. But what can we really expect from a disgusting excuse for a human being such as Billo the Clown?Featured image via screen capture ",News,"April 11, 2017"
 Congress Steps In After Doctor Is Violently Dragged From United Airlines Flight,"Video of a passenger being violently dragged from a United Airlines flight has gone viral, and now Congress wants answers.Audra D. Bridges, who filmed the shocking video and posted it to social media, told the Courier-Journal that passengers were informed that the flight was overbooked at the gate. The airline originally said that one person would need to give up their seat. After everyone had boarded the plane, they were told that four passengers would have to give up the seat they had paid for so that airline employees would be able to fly instead.They asked for volunteers and even offered money and hotel accommodations to sweeten the deal. But when no one offered to leave the plane, they randomly selected passengers to kick off the flight. When the man they had chosen to boot out of the seat he paid for said he didn t want to leave because he was a doctor and had patients he had to care for in the morning, United Airlines called the police.In the video, you can see the cops forcefully grab the doctor and violently drag him off the plane while he screams out in pain. Other passengers were horrified. He was eventually allowed back on the plane, bleeding mouth and all.Now, Washington, D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), a senior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is demanding answers. Norton is calling for a congressional hearing into the incident. I deplore the violent removal of a passenger from a United Airlines flight this weekend. Airline passengers must have protections against such abusive treatment. I am asking our committee for a hearing, which will allow us to question airport police, United Airlines personnel, and airport officials, among others, about whether appropriate procedures were in place in Chicago and are in place across the United States when passengers are asked to leave a flight,  Norton said in a statement.Norton said that she will be following up with a letter to committee chairman Rep. Bill Shuster (R-PA) and Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-N.J.), chairman of the aviation subcommittee, to request a hearing to investigate this incident and others like it.You can watch the disturbing video below:@United overbook #flight3411 and decided to force random passengers off the plane.

" Sean Spicer BLOWS Press Briefing, Contradicts Trump Administration With INSANE Statement On Russia (VIDEO)","Donald Trump may have been cozying up to Russia during his presidential campaign and the beginning of his presidency, but it looks like the relationship is turning sour thanks to his reckless decision to attack Syria, one of Russia s allies.Russia openly condemned the attack, and even threatened to retaliate against the United States thanks to Trump. However, White House Press Secretary must have not gotten the memo, because he called Russia one of America s allies in reference to Syria during his press briefing on Monday.Not only is that statement false (especially after this Syria fiasco) but Spicer greatly contradicted many people in the Trump administration, and even Trump himself. It s obvious that Russia is a hostile power   not an ally   but Spicer still said that America would work with allies, including Russia, in committing to ensuring that there are places that are free from violence You can watch Spicer make a fool of himself below:To be fair, Trump s administration does seem to be awfully confused about how it feels about Russia. One one hand, Trump has showed Russian leader Vladimir Putin with praise, yet at times insists that he doesn t know Putin at all. Nikki Haley, our United Nations ambassador, has said Russia cannot be trusted. After the attack in Syria, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson insulted Russia and said the country was complicit or incompetent. New National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster considers Russia an adversary.If only the Trump administration could actually send a unified, coherent message  but in an administration this incompetent, chaotic, and corrupt, we shouldn t expect too much. Spicer s reference to Russia as  allies  is embarrassing to the Trump administration, as its own Press Secretary seems clueless about how things are actually unfolding after Trump s disastrous attack on Syria, and the true definition of an ally.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"
 This Poll Shows EXACTLY How Much Americans Detest Trump,"At this point in Trump s disastrous presidency, it s pretty clear that the only one that thinks he s doing a great job is the underserving POTUS himself. Even his own supporters have lost faith in him and are turning away at record speed. Despite his rapidly plummeting approval rating, Trump still thinks he s the greatest thing to happen to America   or at least, he ll continue to think that until he sees this:According to MSNBC s Kyle Griffin, Americans are so turned off by Trump that they don t even want to get anywhere near a product he touches. Apparently, asking for Trump s support is so toxic that it is basically suicide for businesses. That s quite strange for a reality television star who brags about how good of a businessman he is.Already, we saw Trump make endorsements on his Twitter feed. It turns out, those inappropriate  shoutouts  did way more harm than good. NBC News reported: When Donald Trump won the Oval Office, critics worried he would use his elevated stature to enhance his personal power to pick winners and losers by endorsing products. But new consumer survey data from Simmons Research suggest the Trump presidency may be having the opposite effect on the Trump brand. According to the new data, 78% of Americans would not use and might even boycott any product that Trump endorses. Even amongst Republicans, support is low   only 31% of GOPers said they would be more likely to use a product if Trump endorsed it. Simmons scientist Steven Millman explained this phenomenon: A strong association between Trump and a brand is likely to be damaging to the brand, unless its consumers are strong conservative. This actually makes perfect sense. Trump has singlehandedly destroyed his own Trump brand by creating one of the most hateful, controversial presidential campaigns America had ever seen. His hotels are going down in flames, and so are his other self-branded companies. Even his daughter, Ivanka, is facing business struggles thanks to her father s horrible performance. So it only seems pretty natural that the association with Trump s disgraced name would have the same effect on other businesses.It s official: most of America hates Trump, and we want him to know it.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"
" BREAKING: Republican Governor Arrested On Multiple Charges, GOP In CHAOS","It s the end of Alabama Governor Robert Bentley s political career after he was arrested Monday on charges related to the numerous things he did to cover up an affair. The governor was booked into Montgomery County Jail on two charges related to his failure to disclose campaign information and submitted a letter of resignation shortly afterward.The scandal began to make its way to the public when Bentley fired the head of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, Spencer Collier, who later revealed that he had investigated and seen evidence of an affair between the 74-year-old Bentley and his campaign spokeswoman, Rebekah Mason. This is of course odd given Bentley s opposition to gay marriage on the  one man one woman  basis, but having an affair is not illegal. Unfortunately for him, the rest of the stuff he did is. A press release from the Alabama Ethics Commission details the rest:Today, the Alabama Ethics Commission found probable cause to believe that Governor Robert Bentley committed violations of both the Alabama Ethics Act and the Fair Campaign Practices Act. We have referred those matters to the Montgomery County District Attorney for further consideration and possible prosecution.Intentional violations of the Alabama Ethics Act and the Fair Campaign Practices Act are Class B felonies. The range of punishment for a Class B felony is a prison sentence of between 2 and 20 years per violation, and a fine of up to $20,000.00, per violation. As these matters are still ongoing, the Commission is prohibited by law from any further comment regarding any of the evidence produced or presented in this case.Over the course of this year-long investigation, the Alabama Ethics Commission issued more subpoenas than have been issued by the Commission since it was given subpoena power. Chief Special Agent Tony Goubil and Special Agent Dustin Lansford devoted countless hours in conducting this investigation. They interviewed over 45 witnesses and have analyzed over 33,000 documents in the course of their investigation. The staff of the Commission has worked tirelessly and thoroughly to investigate every Complaint that we received. The evidence was reviewed and tested multiple times by career lawyers. These lawyers include Hugh Evans our General Counsel who has devoted his career to Ethics, as well as our new Assistant General Counsel, Cynthia Propst Raulston, a career prosecutor whose experience includes analyzing and successfully trying complex white collar and public corruption cases to conclusion before juries. Our Commissioners, who include two retired Circuit Judges, two career attorneys and a doctor, all of whom have vast experience sifting through evidence, judging the testimony of witnesses and applying difficult principles in a fair, even-handed manner, ultimately weighed the evidence and returned this finding.Justice (if you can call it that) moved swiftly after his arrest. Bentley copped a plea and was fined $2,000 and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. He also agreed not to run for office again..@GovernorBentley:  I have decided it is time for me to step down as Alabama s governor   FTR #ForTheRecord @MSNBC https://t.co/AMmmRIrxBF  Greta Van Susteren (@greta) April 10, 2017This, as strange as it sounds, should strike fear in the heart of Donald Trump. As a man who regularly bullies anyone who criticizes him or correctly states inconvenient facts and as someone who has a history of firing people who were investigating him or those close to him, Bentley s arrest should be a clear message that no matter how much you abuse your power to cover up something   in Trump s case his campaign s collusion with a hostile foreign dictator   the American people won t let you get away with it.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 10, 2017"
" While Her Department Gets Gutted, Billionaire Betsy DeVos DEMANDS Extra Expensive Security","Donald Trump and his administration seem to be all about austerity, as long as it s the nation suffering and not his family or employees. Trump s education secretary, Betsy DeVos isn t suffering. In fact, she s the only cabinet member that requires security from not jut the Secret Service, but from US marshals, and it s costing the schools she oversees a lot of money.No one is telling us why DeVos needs the extra security, but the Marshalls are sending a bill to the Education Department in the amount of $8 million to cover about eight months. While that s a drop in the bucket for a department whose budget is about $70 billion, that money is coming straight from the nation s children s educations.The new outlay is a tiny fraction of the department s budget, but comes as the Trump administration has proposed slashing the spending plan by $9 billion, or 13.5 percent.DeVos is the only Cabinet secretary under the protection of the marshals, law enforcement officers who are generally responsible for protecting federal judges, transporting prisoners, apprehending fugitives and protecting witnesses. They also guard the deputy attorney general and Supreme Court justices when they travel.Source: Washington PostDeVos s security team changed from Secret Service to the Marshalls after some protesters blocked her entry into a school shortly after her confirmation. The protest was completely non-violent. Other than that, we have no clue why the apparent overreaction.Note that DeVos is rich, very rich, even richer than her boss. She and her family are worth about $5.1 billion. If we can find a single rationale for putting the super rich in the higher eschelons of government, it should be that they could fray some of they cost, right?It seems, though, as if the super rich in government are now just taking their money making skills and using them to bilk the American taxpayers. Trump is making the taxpayers pay for a vacation a week and, now, DeVos s security is coming   literally   from the mouths and brains of children.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.

 This Reporter Just Won The Biggest Prize In Journalism For Exposing Trump’s Lies (DETAILS),"The winners of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize have been announced and this year s theme was all about exposing Trump.Of particular note was the prize for National Reporting going to David A. Fahrenthold of The Washington Post, whose contribution to reporting during the presidential campaign was to unflinchingly go after Trump s lies, particularly as they related to his contributions to charity.As the Pulitzer committee put it, Fahrenthold deserved the award:For persistent reporting that created a model for transparent journalism in political campaign coverage while casting doubt on Donald Trump s assertions of generosity toward charities.During a campaign when many reporters and pundits struggled to keep up with Trump s lies, or pretended Trump wasn t lying at all, Fahrenthold decided to hold Trump s feet to the fire. After Trump repeatedly dodged questions about his donations to charity, Fahrenthold compiled an exhaustive list of charities Trump was said to have given money to and painstakingly eliminated each one. In the end, the reporting showed that Trump was perhaps one of the least charitable rich people in the country. He also ran down individual anecdotes exposing Trump has a showboating opportunist who cynically exploited charity events for PR but avoided giving any money.In one example discovered by Fahrenthold, Trump stagecrashed an event meant to honor donors, stole the seat of a legitimate donor and then left before anyone knew what had just happened. Nobody knew he was coming,  said Abigail Disney, another donor sitting on the dais.  There s this kind of ruckus at the door, and I don t know what was going on, and in comes Donald Trump. [He] just gets up on the podium and sits down. Trump was not a major donor. He was not a donor, period. He d never given a dollar to the nursery or the Association to Benefit Children, according to Gretchen Buchenholz, the charity s executive director then and now.It is for exposing stories like this and others that Fahrenthold has become reviled in the Trump White House and in conservative circles. He does what fearless journalism has always done: Speak truth to power.Hilariously, Farhrenthold isn t the only person to win the prestigious award for his coverage of Trump. Miami Herald cartoonist Jim Morin earned a Pulitzer for equally biting criticism of Trump. To highlight the point, his latest cartoon is a particularly brutal take down of Trump.Another loudmouth draft-dodging sanctimonious hypocrite phony patriot republican sending us to war #morintoon #TrumpSyria #ChemicalAttack pic.twitter.com/YHXtRaRff3  Jim Morin (@MorinToon) April 8, 2017And the New York Times took home the international reporting Pulitzer for coverage that also caused Trump no shortage of headaches. The paper exposed the rampant corruption and cruelty of the Putin regime in Russia. This made things extremely awkward for Trump. He, of course, benefited greatly from Putin s willingness to undermine democracy   specifically America s 2016 election. Trump has also praised the autocrat as a strong leader and at one time claimed him as a friend.It s extremely telling that so many of the top honors went to people who either directly or indirectly stood up to Trump s administration   whether it be clear-eyed reporting on the corruption from within the White House or the disastrous effects of the policies they and their allies in Congress have forced upon the country. In dark days, fearless critical reporting is more valuable than ever. And with Trump already threatening to crank up censorship laws, it s a rare and powerful commodity.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"
 What Republicans Are Doing To Stop People From Voting Is As Dirty As It Gets,"Let s face it, if it weren t for gerrymandering, Russian interference and straight up lies, Republicans would never hold another majority again and they d certainly never hold the presidency. Unfortunately, that s not our reality and Republicans in Iowa are so desperate that they are turning to lies to keep people from voting.Iowa s Secretary of State, Paul Pete, wants to pass stricter voting restrictions in an effort to keep undesirables (Democrats   especially Democrats of Color) from voting and he s lying to justify it.To substantiate his argument, Pate s office drafted a statement for a reporter from the local Gazette newspaper, noting that in Iowa it appeared 41 felons had cast ballots and that more than 200 election day voter registrations, or EDRs, had bounced back. The draft statement included the caveats that the irregularities  do not necessarily constitute fraud  and that the state would have a more complete picture of election data come March. Pate urged his staff to release it. We need to release info and these stats are public already. When an auditor turns them over to the county attorney or sheriff for action that pretty much makes it public. Am I missing something?,  he wrote in an email.Source: Huffington PostIn a state of three million people, 41 felons voting doesn t exactly seem like a reason to change voting laws for everyone, but even that paltry number is vastly misleading. According to Pate s deputy, Carol Olson: I do not believe that we should say that 41 felons illegally cast ballots. We encouraged them to use provisional ballots, so that would feel a little like we baited them to do something illegal,  she wrote.  And it s risky to label it  illegal  because we don t know the circumstances. It might be illegal, but [it] might not be, if someone really believed their rights were restored. We can report the number of felons voting, but let s not call it illegal,  she wrote.Olson noted that some of the statistics suggested something nefarious when it could simply be attributed to human error. I m also really reluctant to say that 207 EDR s (sic) from 15 counties bounced back. In the context of a discussion on election fraud, it sounds like we are suggesting that  bounce backs  are fraud or likely to be fraud,  she wrote.  First, it s only a partial report. What about the other 84 counties? How does this fit into the overall process of EDRs? The vast majority of these  bounce-backs  are sloppy addresses from voters in too much of a hurry when they register at the polls. That s a real reason to discourage EDR and a real reason to have pollbooks, but it s not an indicator of illegal activity. Regardless, it s likely the bill, that will require voter IDs, will pass, nearly ensuring that the state, which has long been a red-leaning swing state, will become a red state.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"April 10, 2017"
" Wife Of Arrested Russian Hacker Just Spoke Out, And Trump Is Shaking In His Boots","The wife of a Russian hacker who was arrested in Spain has spoken out, confirming that her husband, Pyotr Levashov, was (allegedly) involved in hacking our election. I asked for a warrant or some papers, they said they showed them to my husband,  Maria Levashova says.  With my husband, I talked to the commissariat by phone, he said that he was shown some piece of paper in Spanish without a seal and his photo in poor quality. Something was said about the fact that the virus my husband allegedly created was related to Trump s victory in the elections. Levashov, better recognized as  Peter Severa  and  Peter of the North  in hacking circles, is well-known in the cybercrime community. Krebs on Security reports:According to numerous stories here at KrebsOnSecurity, Levashov was better known as  Severa,  the hacker moniker used by a pivotal figure in many Russian-language cybercrime forums. Severa was the moderator for the spam subsection of multiple online communities, and in this role served as the virtual linchpin connecting virus writers with huge spam networks   including some that Severa allegedly created and sold himself.Levashov is currently listed as #7 in the the world s Top 10 Worst Spammers list maintained by anti-spam group Spamhaus. The U.S. Justice Department maintains that Severa was the Russian partner of Alan Ralsky, a convicted American spammer who specialized in  pump-and-dump  spam schemes designed to artificially inflate the value of penny stocks.Levashov allegedly went by the aliases Peter Severa and Peter of the North (Pyotr is the Russian form of Peter). My reporting indicates that   in addition to spamming activities   Severa was responsible for running multiple criminal operations that paid virus writers and spammers to install  fake antivirus  software. So-called  fake AV  uses malware and/or programming tricks to bombard the victim with misleading alerts about security threats, hijacking the PC until its owner either pays for a license to the bogus security software or figures out how to remove the invasive program.There is ample evidence that Severa is the cybercriminal behind the Waledac spam botnet, a spam engine that for several years infected between 70,000 and 90,000 computers and was capable of sending approximately 1.5 billion spam messages a day.In 2010, Microsoft launched a combined technical and legal sneak attack on the Waledac botnet, successfully dismantling it. The company would later do the same to the Kelihos botnet, a global spam machine which shared a great deal of computer code with Waledac.The connection between Waledac/Kelihos and Severa is supported by data leaked in 2010 after hackers broke into the servers of pharmacy spam affiliate program SpamIt. According to the stolen SpamIt records, Severa   this time using the alias  Viktor Sergeevich Ivashov    brought in revenues of $438,000 and earned commissions of $145,000 spamming rogue online pharmacy sites over a 3-year period.Severa also was a moderator of Spamdot.biz (pictured in the first screenshot above), a vetted, members-only forum that at one time attracted almost daily visits from most of Russia s top spammers. Leaked Spamdot forum posts for Severa indicate that he hails from Saint Petersburg, Russia s second-largest city.Sevara is currently in custody in Barcelona, but is subject to an extradition request by the United States. Spanish news website El Confidencial also confirms that the arrest was related to hacking that helped Donald Trump  win  the election.With Trump screaming FAKE NEWS every time new facts come out about his collusion with Vladimir Putin to take the Oval Office by any means necessary   even if it does involve some Russian hackers, an aggressive propaganda campaign, and probably a couple Russian pee pee hookers   this news is not good for him. We can fully expect a meltdown on some sort on Twitter as soon as Breitbart reports on the arrest.Featured image via Getty Images/Pool",News,"April 10, 2017"
 Trump Slapped With Lawsuit For Refusing To Release White House Visitor Logs,"Donald Trump is being sued   again. Three organizations have joined together to file suit against Mango Mussolini for his refusal to make White House visitor logs public.The National Security Archive, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University have all filed a suit against the Department of Homeland Security under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Trump has ignored FOIA requests for the visitor logs and the suit is asking that the records be released. We hoped that the Trump administration would follow the precedent of the Obama administration and continue to release visitor logs, but unfortunately they have not,  CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement. Given the many issues we have already seen in this White House with conflicts of interest, outside influence, and potential ethics violations, transparency is more important than ever, so we had no choice but to sue. The three groups suing Trump are asking not only that the visitor logs for the White House be released, but also that he make records public from Mar-a-Lago where he holds many of his meetings, particularly on weekends. Trump likes to use his resort to schmooze foreign leaders, most recently meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping there just last week.Tom Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive, said in a statement that the release of this information has been routine for many years. In September 2009, the Obama administration announced that they would release records of all visitors to the White House following multiple lawsuits that were filed by CREW. President Obama routinely released the data we re seeking with no damage to presidential privilege, and this information is central to the Secret Service mission and thus clearly agency records subject to FOIA,  Blanton said.According to another employee working for the National Security Archive, they were responsible for filing the first FOIA against the current administration just three days after Trump was sworn into office on January 23. When foreign officials go to see the president or his staff, the American people have a right to know who and when,  explained National Security Archive senior policy analyst Kate Doyle.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"
 Racist Rep. Steve King Gives Trump DIRE Warning: Don’t Abandon White Supremacists (TWEET),"Congressman Steve King (R-IA) is pretty much the most openly racist person sitting in Congress. He recently came under fire for tweeting openly white supremacist sentiments about  western civilization  and not being able to restore it with  somebody else s babies.  Here is that awful tweet:Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies. https://t.co/4nxLipafWO  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) March 12, 2017Now, he is giving Donald Trump a warning about sidelining white supremacist Steve Bannon in the White House in favor of more left-leaning advisers like Trump s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner. This warning comes because word on the street is that there is a battle brewing between Bannon and Kushner, and it seems that Bannon is losing big time. In fact, Bannon may indeed be on his way out.Well, this is not sitting well with the white supremacists who have championed Trump so long and so hard, and indeed were instrumental in putting him into the White House. They even deliberately trended #FireKushner to send a message to Trump about where his priorities should lie. Rep. King chimed in with similar sentiments Sunday night, tweeting at Trump:@RealDonaldTrump Steve Bannon is the lynchpin to your energized base. Conservatives are an endangered species in your White House.  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) April 10, 2017So, in other words, King is warning Trump that if he gives in to what the alt-right (read: white supremacists) call Ivanka and Jared s  globalist  leanings and policies, he s finished and his base will turn on him. This is probably true. However, the idea that Trump would pick Bannon in a showdown between the former Breitbart head and his daughter and son-in-law is downright laughable. So, suck it, Steve King. You won t be getting your way on this one.If the Bannon v. Kushner feud continues, Bannon will be pushed out, and there will be marginally more reasonable people who have Trump s ear. The side effect will be a betrayed and outraged alt-right and conservative base, which will ensure Donald Trump s defeat in 2020, along with his feuding with the Republicans on Capitol Hill who will surely not bow to his daughter and son-in-law s largely Democratic policies.So, bad for Republicans and Trump world, great for America.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"
 Trump Is A MONSTROUS Threat To A Vital Government Function That Nobody Is Talking About,"When people talk about the threat that Donald Trump poses to the U.S., they generally talk about things like education, the environment, consumers, workers, immigrants, minorities, and so on. His  Make America Great Again  slogan is nothing more than hot air, and anybody who s been paying attention knows it. But there s one absolutely vital government function that Trump threatens that nobody s talking about. It s a safe bet that most of us actually haven t even thought of it, despite his warning to federal agencies to prepare for massive budget cuts.It s the U.S. Census. And the Census is something we need. Population counts determine the number of U.S. Representatives a state gets, and they also determine how the states  districts get redrawn. Even states with independent commissions depend on the Census to know how best to draw district lines.Census data is also used for federal programs affecting things like education, veterans  services, rural development, transportation, housing and more. The Census determines the allocation of funding for the following:And so much more, including in the private sector   businesses can use Census data to determine everything from optimal location to understanding both the local labor force and the local consumer population. Of course, most of this is stuff that the Trump administration and the Republican Party see as wastes anyway, but they ll be hard-pressed to actually cut funding for all of this in a budget without facing massive backlash.Hmm. Now that we re thinking about it, maybe sabotaging the Census would be their way of gutting all these programs.That list, while a ton, isn t all. There s also what Trump s stance on immigration could do. ICE has been sweeping cities for undocumented immigrants, even targeting courthouses as immigrants show up for hearings and appointments about pretty much everything. In fact, a judge in Washington State reported hearing that undocumented immigrants are missing court dates, even if they were seeking a protective order against an abuser.We have the growing hate and fear of Muslims to contend with, too   while they aren t being arrested and deported (yet), they could worry that answering the Census will expose sensitive information and make them more vulnerable to harassment and attack.For these reasons, immigrants and other minorities may find themselves far less willing to participate in the 2020 Census. And in communities that have high immigrant and/or minority populations, that could result in bad undercounts. Undercounts that are bad enough could result in districts, especially those that are done by independent commissions, being inadvertently redrawn in ways that don t accurately represent the states  populations.It could also result in impoverished, high-immigrant communities seeing necessary federal dollars drain away from programs they depend on.Now, okay, the Census is still three years away. But Trump s funding cuts have already forced them to scrap plans for some new field offices that would help the Census go more smoothly, and has also forced them to cancel the dry runs they do every decade in the run-up to the actual Census. That tells us that just conducting the 2020 Census is very likely to be problematic.They re asking us to do it online this year (partly as a cost-cutting measure, because of course), which raises cybersecurity concerns and could exacerbate immigrants  and minorities  fears of having ICE come knock at their door, or having asshat racists attack and/or harass them. Following hacks courtesy of everyone from Russia to the Shadow Brokers (who recently hacked the NSA), they re going to have one hell of a time convincing us that our data will be safe and secure.The problems Trump and the GOP are causing for the Census are nothing to shrug at. So much of the way this country is run depends on an accurate Census count, and they re going to have a really difficult time.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"
 Alec Baldwin Makes Bombshell Announcement That’s Going To ENRAGE Trump,"If things keep going as they are, we may see a surprising candidate on the 2020 presidential ballot. Our favorite Donald Trump impersonator could be running against Trump.59-year-old Alec Baldwin might throw his hat in the ring, because according to him, there s no one who can beat Trump. I would love to run for office because I think people need something different. I think that all the people that are on deck in 2020, none of them are going to win,  the 59-year-old actor   who plays Trump on  Saturday Night Live    told  Extra  in an interview released Tuesday.Without naming names, Baldwin reiterated,  None of those people are going to beat him. Source: The HillBaldwin s wife doesn t seem to be on board. During the interview, she shook her head and said,  we re not going to do that. Baldwin, though warned that if Trump were to be reelected, things would be a lot worse. You think things are bad now?  the performer added.  I ll tell you when things are going to be worse   if he wins again. Baldwin has been playing Trump for a while now, to popular acclaim. He performed both that role and the role of Bill O Reilly on Saturday Night Live on Saturday.Here s the video:That s not the same as actually being president, though, but the fact that Trump is in office could ironically be reason Baldwin might stand a chance.Baldwin is a popular liberal who has long been very vocal about politics, but he s no stranger to controversy. In 2013, he left a message for his daughter calling her a  rude thoughtless pig.  Last year, he called a reporter by a gay slur.In normal political times, Baldwin s lack of political experience, along with his caught-on-tape controversies, would be an immediate deal breaker, but these are not normal times. Baldwin s flaws are far less glaring than Trump s. Then again, Democrats are always held to a higher standard than Republicans.Featured image via D. Dipasupil/Getty Images. ",News,"April 9, 2017"
 Women In The World Founder Has The PERFECT Description For Trump’s Crazy Presidency (VIDEO),"This past week was the annual Women in the World Summit. It s a place that celebrates women who have a voice, and who speak for those who do not. It is a place of celebration, discussion, strategy, and empowerment. It is also a place for women to speak their minds. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton definitely spoke her mind on that stage. Now that the Summit is over, its founder, Tina Brown, is sounding off on Donald Trump s presidency.Appearing on CNN s Reliable Sources, Brown told host Brian Stelter of what it feels like to watch Trump: It s almost like being in the ward of a mental hospital half the time, with what s going on with Trump. I mean, you can t make this up. Stelter then asks,  You mean we re all the patients of the mental hospital? Brown responds: You know, watching his behavior, you know it s like watching out of control that s what makes it such riveting viewing. He seems so  his entire administration seems to be so out of control. Unfortunately it s addictive. Stelter then joked about a New Yorker cartoon that quipped about people  binge watching CNN,  and asked Brown if that was a bad thing. Brown responded: It s a disastrous thing, because, you know, you re actually talking about very serious things that are not being discussed, and that is what is so scary about it. I mean, I was thinking the other day, how many hours have been spent by everybody in Washington in the you know, last two months, whether it is the Intelligence community or the National Security community.. everybody trying to retrofit the crazy tweet about being eavesdropped by Obama. It s like the need to backfill his mendacity by so many different agencies is the most time-consuming thing right now in government. Stelter then lamented: It was a month ago, and we re never going to get that month back. Brown concluded: Think about all the things that weren t done in that month. Tina Brown is correct. It s like being in a mental hospital, or perhaps in the back of a car driven by a very drunk driver who thinks he is sober and refuses to stop so people who know better can hop out. The people who have the power to take us off this crazy train won t, so we re stuck. Hopefully, we survive.Watch the fascinating exchange below:Tina Brown:  It s almost like being in the ward of a mental hospital half the time, with what s going on with Trump  https://t.co/DH6Ywnnfni  Reliable Sources (@ReliableSources) April 2, 2017Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 9, 2017"

The Alti-Right leader spoke to the crowd at the rally then he was confronted by counter-protesters who shouted  Go home Nazis  and called him a  Nazi snowflake,  according to Anti-Fascist News.The confrontation between the two groups became heated then the counter-protesters chased Spencer across the park as police followed along.The police protected Spencer and his Nazi buddies.Secret Service & cops in Washington DC protecting Richard Spencer & Nazis from #NoWarNoNazis.

 Trump Builds Helipad At Mar-A-Lago So He Can Avoid Protesters While Golfing Each Weekend,"Trump s weekend trips to Mar-a-Lago and his nearby golf course have repeatedly been met with crowds of protesters.

Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 8, 2017Trump clearly doesn t enjoy seeing reminders that his presidency is highly unpopular. This appears to be Trump s solution:The newest addition to Mar a Lago  a helipad and Trump chopper. pic.twitter.com/Hxb8QyR8Uu  Vivian Salama (@vmsalama) April 9, 2017Trump s administration claims the helipad was built to carry Trump from the airport to his resort without interrupting traffic. They also conceded that traffic will likely still be blocked off or otherwise disrupted near the resort each time he is in town   roughly once a week. And like everything Trump does, the helipad comes at the expense of the average people unlucky enough to live nearby Trump s resort.When the proposal was first drawn up, it faced criticism for its disruptions to the lives of those around the area:Jesse H. Diner, a Fort Lauderdale attorney representing Woodbridge Avenue resident Nancy deMoss, urged commissioners to hold off on approving the project until they consider alternatives to the location. These are big helicopters, they re like flying tanks,  Diner said.DeMoss requires around-the-clock health care that has been impacted by Trump s weekend visits. Diner said she and her family is worried that the loud helicopters will be a nuisance, and she is uncomfortable with the U.S. Coast Guard boats sporting guns when Trump is in town.Trump went ahead with the plan anyway.Adding more absurdity, Trump s personal helicopter appears to be using the helipad this weekend. The official Marine One, nor Trump, have used the helipad so far, but a giant helicopter with Trump s name printed in red across the tail sat in its spot. Trump s staff said it would be  staged  there until Sunday   a shameless photo op attempt.It s also not clear whether Trump or taxpayers are paying for the helipad used exclusively to indulge Trump s golf obsession. The helipad was registered by the National Trust for Historic Preservation suggesting Trump wants to treat his helipad as a site of national significance as if it s Mount Rushmore and not an excuse for Trump to take more vacations.If the cost of the helipad indeed comes out of the pockets of taxpayers it will be a stiff addition to the already $23 million Trump has spent taking vacations while president for just 11 weeks. At this rate, Trump is projected to eclipse Obama s entire cost of travel in just 10 months.It s for this reason that Trump appears desperate to rebrand his opulent resort as the  Southern White House  in order to deflect criticisms that he s too often partying there instead of doing the job of president. It would be unsurprising to find that someday Trump renames the 18th hole at his Florida golf course after the Oval Office.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 9, 2017"
 O’Reilly And Trump Bond Over Sexual Harassment In Alec Baldwin’s Most Creative SNL Skit Yet (VIDEO),"We all love seeing Alec Baldwin portray Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, but last night he pulled another ace out of his sleeve when he debuted as Bill O Reilly. But it gets better   Baldwin s Bill O Reilly interviews Baldwin s Donald Trump!As the sketch opens, O Reilly addresses his audience on a serious note: Hello, I m Bill O Reilly, and I hope you are having a terrific evening, The subject of tonight s Talking Points Memo is a scandal everyone s been talking about all week. A scandal no one thought I would have the guts to address head on. It appears he s going to address his sexual harassment issues, but instead he reveals his true talking point: The shocking allegations of the abuse of power that have been leveled against the Obama administration. He then attempts to introduce Fox News reporter Laurie Dhue (one of the actual women who received a settlement after filing a sexual harassment suit). After he s told that she no longer works for Fox News, O Reilly asks,  Well, did she receive the check? After speaking to another female reporter who, for obvious reasons, had to stay 500 yards away from him, he goes on to address the issues he s having with sponsors leaving the show. As you know, 60 of our sponsors have pulled ads from the program,  O Reilly said, before going to commercial break.  No word as to why yet. We thank the following for sticking with us. After that, fake ads played for dog cocaine and horse Cialis. Now this is hard for me to discuss, but I also have been in the news this week,  Baldwin s O Reilly said after the break.  Several women have come forward and accused me of offering them exciting opportunities here at Fox News. Beyond that, the details are fuzzy, but one man was brave enough to come to my defense. A man who is unimpeachable on all female issues. Cue Donald Trump who did, in real life, come to O Reilly s defense this past week. The two then appear together in split screen. I actually see a lot of myself in you, Bill,  Baldwin s Trump said, calling himself a  big fan  of the host. O Reilly then thanks him for his support and asks him if he is actually familiar with the case. I m more familiar with this case than, say, health care, but I didn t really look into it much, no. I was busy being super presidential by bombing a bunch of shit. Baldwin s O Reilly then thanked him for promoting Sexual Assault Awareness Month and Trump said: That s right, Bill.

 Rep. Ted Lieu Issues Blistering Takedown Of Trump’s Illegal Missile Strike (VIDEO),"Anyone who knows anything about the separation of powers understands that a president cannot just unilaterally take military action. He needs approval from Congress to execute an act of war. However, since Donald Trump is president and he seems to think he is somehow above the law, he doesn t bother with silly little details like that. As a result, we got his launching of 59 Tomahawk missiles into a Syrian airfield. It turns out that quite a few people in Congress believe what Trump did to be potentially illegal. One such person is Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA).Rep. Lieu is one of Trump s harshest critics and perhaps his most prolific Twitter troll. When it came to Trump s military action in Syria, Lieu did not mince words. Speaking with MSNBC s Katy Tur, Lieu said: Clearly, the president can take limited actions that the Congress has authorized such as going against terrorists who were involved with 9/11 or in terms of Iraq when Congress authorized the use of force in 2002, but there s been no congressional authorization to launch fifty-nine cruise missiles at a country that has not attacked us. Donald Trump s action last night was unconstitutional. He should not do it again. Rep. Lieu then went on to explain his problems with the launch and the dangers of taking such drastic action with no authorization and no clear strategy, after being asked if he would have authorized this action if he had been given the opportunity to do so: I might have if he would have articulated a strategy, and that is one of my fundamental problems with what he did. There has been no coherent strategy from the Trump administration. Last week, they signaled they were okay with Assad even though he had previously killed hundreds of thousands of people in Syria and used chemical weapons. Last night, they attacked the Assad regime. We need to know what is the Trump administration thinking and what is their long-term strategy in Syria? Rep. Lieu is right. Trump s actions went against the Constitution. He cannot unilaterally make war. Further, he is clearly an erratic, impulsive man. Said erratic, impulsive man now has the power to destroy the world with one temper tantrum. Therefore, more than ever, it is absolutely imperative that Congress use its Article I powers to check and balance this dangerously unstable president.Watch Rep. Lieu s remarks below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 9, 2017"

 Sean Penn TORE Steve Bannon To RIBBONS After Being Asked About About Working Together,"Sean Penn is not exactly one to mince words, and he didn t mince words when he was asked about the time he worked with Steve Bannon on a film project. Bannon has a heavy history of bankrolling and doing other work on films, even as recently as 2012. He was an executive producer for  The Indian Runner,  which was Penn s first time directing.Penn was not nice when talking about Bannon, and that s putting it mildly. He actually said: Bannon was then, as he is now, simply another bitter Hollywood wannabe who went rogue by way of toxic narcissistic iconoclasm. But, deep in his heart, he s just a conniving hateful bloated punk who despises mankind. And then there are also the bad things about him And then there are also the bad things about him  Wow. Just wow. We ve known since Bannon came into the spotlight a year ago that he was a complete dick who loves bullying people. Earlier this year, film critic Ann Hornaday wrote a piece for the Washington Post that talks about what we can learn about Bannon from watching the films he made.Many of his films are directly tied to his worldview   in fact, he s an extreme right-wing version of Michael Moore in that respect. He s spent a lot of time attacking  the permanent political class,  in his films, along with  hippies and community organizers  who allegedly hate this country and hate the Constitution. He s gone after Hillary Clinton and President Obama, but also Dick Cheney and George W. Bush. In short, he hates the whole world and everyone in it who doesn t see it exactly the way he does.Which seems to be exactly what Penn was describing in his mini-diatribe.Bannon is also someone who issues threats and ultimatums and strong-arms people into doing things his way. His narcissistic ego likely suffered a massive blow when he tried to bully Republicans on their farce of a healthcare bill by saying,  This is not a discussion. This is not a debate. You have no choice but to vote for this bill. Even before that sorry excuse of a bill failed, just the idea of Republicans not following his orders was enough for him to urge Trump to create a  shit list.  When Republicans scoffed in his general direction over his  orders,  it was very likely a humiliating defeat for him.So  he s just a conniving hateful bloated punk who despises mankind,  is a damned accurate description of him.Image of Sean Penn by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for The Hollywood Reporter.

And unfortunately for them, there s a new analysis out that points to something besides their dire predictions.Standard & Poor s took a look at the performance of many Blue Cross Blue Shield plans across nearly 36 states, and found that the insurers under Blue Cross Blue Shield actually reduced their losses in 2016, will probably break even this year, and will start seeing a profit from the marketplace in 2018.S&P bluntly gives the lie to the GOP s cries of  death spirals  with this:After years in which many insurers lost money, then lost even more in 2015,  we are seeing the first signs in 2016 that this market could be manageable for most health insurers,  the Standard & Poor s analysts said. The  market is not in a  death spiral. A majority of Americans want Congress to fix the ACA, not  repeal and replace  it anymore. Their sorry attempt at passing a healthcare bill last month further damaged their already-destroyed credibility on the issue, and nearly 70 percent of Americans want to keep the parts of the ACA that are working, and fix the parts that aren t working so well.Also, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report, 33 percent of Americans say that Republicans are responsible for the failure of their farce of a healthcare plan, and another 28 percent say Trump is responsible. Only 25 percent of those surveyed blame Democrats for the bill s failure.It s true that insurers are threatening to pull out of the ACA s marketplace, which will leave some places with only one carrier or without any at all in the marketplace. That s something that could have been changed or prevented if the GOP had actually managed to get something together over the last seven years.Depending on what happens this year, though, that could change. If it does, then Republicans will be out of excuses.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"April 9, 2017"
" Former GOP Rep. Thinks Adam Schiff Should Recuse Himself From Russia Probe Too, Because Reasons","Earlier this week, Devin Nunes finally recused himself from the House Intel Committee s probe on Russian election tampering, putting Mike Conaway of Texas in charge. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, remains in place. Schiff has been working tirelessly to ensure that Nunes  decision to leak classified info, and to talk to Agent Cheeto before the rest of his committee, doesn t derail the House s investigation any more than it has to.But some Republicans are apparently unhappy with Schiff still being there. One such Republican is former House Intel Chairman Mike Rogers, who seems to think that if Nunes had to recuse himself from the probe, then Schiff should likewise recuse himself. His reasoning is almost as batty as Mike Conaway s reasoning that Mexican performing artists are the same as Russian hackers: Representative Adam Schiff should consider recusing himself from the probe. For his part, Schiff suggested to the media that he had seen information on Russia-Trump campaign ties that was  the kind of evidence  that would be presented to a grand jury, adding that he had seen additional evidence, but not elaborating further. He went on to ask how the committee could continue doing its business when secret information is publicly discussed, even by innuendo. Except Schiff didn t go running to others with documents in hand. He simply explained how he interpreted what he had seen, without revealing what he had seen.Republicans seem to be incapable of making valid comparisons.Rogers has a serious problem with Schiff because he believes that Schiff politicized the committee s investigation. He couldn t be more wrong. It was Nunes who politicized it when he took information directly to Trump before presenting it to the rest of the committee.Rogers is right about one thing: The committee needs to get back on track as soon as possible. That won t happen without Schiff, though, because he s been relentless in trying to keep the committee on track. Rogers  call for him to recuse himself positively reeks of,  No fair!

 Paul Ryan Makes PERFECT Argument For Medicare For All; Dumbass Didn’t Even Realize (TWEETS),"Sometimes you just need to let people talk and they ll eventually say what you have been saying the whole time. Albeit, it may be accidental. And in this case, liberals should take what they can get when it comes to Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) giving a the perfect argument for Medicare for all. They should also not let him forget it.While trying to make the Affordable Care Act look bad, Ryan accidentally made the perfect argument for Medicare for all.Ryan tweeted out: With another insurer leaving the Iowa insurance market, more Americans will be left without a choice when it comes to their health care.

This is unacceptable. Five Iowa counties will now be left with just two health insurers, while the rest will only have one option. This is unacceptable.  Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) April 8, 2017Now, first of all, if Iowa had set up Obamacare properly, they d have their own health exchange and not put you to the national website. This would have also subsequently given Iowa insurers the ability to work directly with the state. Secondly, when for-profit companies are given the ability to mess with people s care for the sake of profit and to try to prove a point that something  isn t working  they will do so.Thus, when all is said and done, this is the perfect argument for Medicare for all, OR at least a public option. A public option would provide a guaranteed option for citizens of any state, as well as provide competition in the for-profit world of health insurance, which would then drive down costs across the board (yay, true capitalism and not a manipulative market!). Medicare for all would be ideal, yet not as realistic at the moment, and would provide care to every single American. Imagine that! Taxes being used for tax payers!When all is said and done, we can thank Paul Ryan for this perfect meme to use against him time and time again.

 Images Of Trump Golfing In Florida Leak Despite Him Ordering Press Pool To Stay Inside,"Trump s war on  leakers  who make him look bad by exposing his lies is about to escalate. On Saturday, a CNN reporter managed to snap a few pictures of Trump playing golf for the 15th time as president, despite efforts by his staff to stop it. No doubt, the reporter will face recriminations from the Trump team for doing his job.This is the state our nation has been reduced to: A president so committed to vacations in the face of dismal approval ratings that he locks his press pool up to avoid getting caught doing what he knows looks really, really bad. When they report on it, they get attacked.President Trump playing a round of golf Saturday at his club in West Palm Beach pic.twitter.com/aJ4utIM8po  Kevin Liptak (@Kevinliptakcnn) April 8, 2017The photo is blurry and obscured because Trump did not want to be photographed and took all steps to avoid it.

He just can t stop golfing. Each time he does, he opens himself up to relentless criticism. It s his 15th vacation in 11 weeks. He s spent $23 million in travel expenses. He s golfing while his own White House implodes. But rather than just, say, skip a weekend of golf, he keeps going back.That s a particularly disturbing pathology in a man who wants us to believe he s an effective president.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 8, 2017"
 Dummy-In-Chief Requests Fewer Words And More Pictures Be Used In Intelligence Briefings,"While on the campaign trail in 2016, Donald Trump told his supporters at a rally in South Carolina, I m very highly educated. I know words, I know the best words. But there s no better word than stupid.  Trump was referring to President Barack Obama as  stupid.  However, Obama will be looked back fondly in history as probably one of our greatest presidents, a great orator who inspired the masses, and Trump will not.In January, Trump began receiving his intelligence briefings and his team made a request for fewer words to be used and instead, to use more pictures.The Washington Post reports:The president, they said, was a visual and auditory learner. Would the briefers please cut down on the number of words in the daily briefing book and instead use more graphics and pictures?Similarly, after Trump entered office, his staff took President Barack Obama s Syria contingency plans and broke the intelligence down into more-digestible bites, complete with photos, according to current and former U.S. officials with knowledge of the request.According to senior administration officials and members of Congress who spoke with Trump, it was the image of young, listless children being splashed with water in a frantic attempt to cleanse them of the nerve agent and another one of an anguished father holding his twin babies, swathed in soft white fabric, poisoned to death, that prompted the alleged president to take action after watching cable news.Trump allegedly told his senior staff that the images and footage of what was taking place in Syria was  horrible  and  awful. We can agree that it is, however, it s more likely that Trump is using this as a distraction. After all, this widely circulated photograph of Alan Kurdi, a young refugee child who drowned to death, apparently never disturbed Donald Trump.Trump was also opposed to Obama s attempt to strike Syria when a sarin nerve gas attack left more than 1,400 dead outside of Damascus in 2013. There were images of children who were victims of that gas attack were reported online and on the news, too.Quick question: Ever since Trump ordered a strike on Syria, how much of the news cycle has covered his administration s ties to Russia? Or his conflicts of interest, etc, etc, etc.Image of Alan Kurdi via Wikipedia. Image of the amateur president: screen capture via Trump Draws on Twitter.",News,"April 8, 2017"
 Everyone KNEW Trump Would Be Golfing Again – So Protesters Were Totally Ready When He Showed Up,"There are only three things for certain in this world: Death, taxes, and Trump golfing every weekend. Today featured all three in a way.Two days ago, Trump spent around $90 million in tax dollars to bomb an empty airbase in Syria. The symbolic attack did little to stop the Syrian government s ability to bomb its citizens   bombers were reportedly back to using the airstrip just hours later   but it had the effect of inflaming already high tensions between the United States and supporters of the Syrian regime in Russia and Iran.So covering death and taxes, Trump moved onto golf.The fact that he would go on vacation just days after creating an international crisis was so painfully obvious that protesters planned for it. When Trump s motorcade was spotted on route to his golf course in Florida, the signs came out to greet him. According to reporters riding with Trump, the stuff Trump saw should put to rest any notion that he isn t aware that much of the country despises him.Pool: Motorcade passed ""group of about a dozen protesters w/ signs reading ""Resign,"" ""Loser,"" and ""Impeach Trump"" outside the golf course.""  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 8, 2017It s not clear yet whether Trump plans to lie about his golf outing as he s done in previous weeks. By a rough count, Trump has golfed around 15 times since becoming president 11 weeks ago. Many of those vacations were done in secret, with his staff covering for him with claims that he was in  meetings.  Inevitably, pictures of Trump in golf attire hitting the links turn up online exposing just how shameless this administration is.The fact that protesters can be so certain that Trump will be golfing   even after committing America to a possible war in Syria   is incredibly disheartening. You can plan your day around the assumption that the most powerful person in the country will be slipping into golfing shoes every single weekend. Hilariously, this criticism was most clearly leveled by one of Trump s biggest defenders: Sean Hannity.In 2013, Hannity hypocritically slammed Obama of playing golf during the Syrian civil war.The war in Syria rages on but so far Hannity hasn t complained about any one of Trump s 15 golf outings. Odd. And further undermining Hannity s complaint: Trump has spent so much time golfing that he s now spent a quarter of Obama s total cost in travel expenses in just his first 11 weeks. By the end of his first year, he will have cost the American taxpayer over $100 million.Report: Obama's travel expenses were $97m over eight years.

" Dan Rather Condemns Trump’s Reality Show Tactics In Syria, RIPS Media For Calling Act ‘Presidential’","Unless you ve been living under a rock for the past few days, you now know that our idiot wannabe  president  just used military resources and spent god knows how many millions of taxpayer dollars just to put on a little show in Syria that, instead of making him look good, embarrassed America and pissed off most of the world. It might even have pissed off Russia, though we re still of the belief that Putin was in on this whole scheme.Before Trump fake-attacked Syria late Thursday night, he warned his BFF Putin, who in turn, warned his allies in Syria, who then evacuated the base and surrounding areas. Sadly, 16 innocent civilians were killed in this needless, unforgivable display. Among them, women and children from a local village. The SAME women and children that he stood at his podium Thursday, chest puffed out, promising to protect. Sorry, asshole   your little publicity stunt backfired and you will have to answer for that one day   the sooner the better.What makes this whole f*cked up situation even more disgusting is that journalists all over have been ignoring the obvious   Trump did this as a distraction from investigations into his collusion with Russia and to gain support to boost his record low poll numbers   and they are actually praising him for this act! One of these journalists, shockingly, was CNN host Fareed Zakaria who went on CNN s New Day and said the unthinkable: I think Donald Trump became president of the United States last night. I think this was actually a big moment. After watching his fellow journalists essentially roll over and cave to whatever mystical powers Trump seems to have over the people who support him, one famed and beloved journalist wasn t having it. Dan Rather took to Facebook Friday with a scathing post that ripped those journalists, and especially Donald Trump, to shreds. To Trump, he had this to say:The President of the United States is the Commander in Chief. It is an awesome responsibility. Committing the use of force and American men and women in uniform is about as serious as it gets. But the truly great presidents understand that knowing when NOT to act is as important as knowing when to act.It is a whole lot easier starting wars than finishing them. And there are many historical examples of where a promise of limited engagement quickly metastasized into something much bigger.There is a tendency to rally around the flag, and a president who takes on a war footing can see a boost of support. It is often transitory. There are arguments to be made that President Assad in Syria has crossed a line that demands U.S. military interference. Whether this should have been a unilateral action is something we all must consider. Whether President Trump has a plan for what comes next must be debated. Whether there is a coherence to this missile strike fitting into a larger foreign policy strategy is a question that should give us all pause.He goes on to slay the media and puts them in their place, reminding them that it is their job to ask hard questions. Rather says:There is ample evidence that this Administration needs to face deep scrutiny. The lies we have heard, the chaos in governance, and the looming questions about ties with Russia   itself a major player in Syria   demand that the press treat this latest action with healthy skepticism.He concludes his post with a dire warning that we should all pay very close attention to:The number of members of the press who have lauded the actions last night as  presidential  is concerning. War must never be considered a public relations operation. It is not a way for an administration to gain a narrative. It is a step into a dangerous unknown and its full impact is impossible to predict, especially in the immediate wake of the first strike.What will happen next remains unknown, but one thing is for certain   we can t forget our principles and cave to this monster, no matter how bright and shiny he makes the future sound. He s a liar, a sexual predator, most likely a criminal, and he s most certainly a con artist whose only real public experience was having a reality television show with a famous tagline. That is all he is. Don t forget that.But, we should always keep hope alive that one day soon we will get to say to him,  You re FIRED!  That will be a glorious day!You can read Dan Rather s heartfelt post in its entirety here.Featured image via Getty/Kirk Irwin",News,"April 8, 2017"
 Bill O’Reilly’s Show Bizarrely Cut Short In Wake Of Advertisers’ Mass Exodus (DETAILS),"The New York Times recently published a bombshell story about the culture of sexual harassment at Fox News, and their star host, Bill O Reilly, is at the center of it. The Times story says that O Reilly and Fox News paid five women more than $13 million in hush money who accused O Reilly of sexually harassing them. As a result, more than 50 important advertisers have pulled out of advertising their goods on The O Reilly Factor.In fact, so many ads have been pulled that Thursday s show included almost no ads at all, and certainly none from nationally recognized brands. Seemingly, as a result of all of these companies running as far and fast as they can from the public relations nightmare that is Bill O Reilly, the Thursday night edition of O Reilly s show was bizarrely cut short.There was no explanation for the abrupt ending to O Reilly s broadcast. The show usually lasts an hour, but was only on for 45 minutes. Throughout the show, O Reilly had kept promising a funny segment with Jesse Waters, who usually goes out and talks to people on the street in a mean-spirited segment meant to embarrass people and make them look bad on the air. That segment never came.Instead of the Waters segment, at the end of O Reilly s strangely short show, fellow Fox anchor Shep Smith spent the extra 15 minutes reporting on the goings on in Syria. This was prior to the world knowing that Trump had launched 59 tomahawk cruise missiles into a Syrian airfield in response to the chemical weapons attack, so it s not like this was any sort of breaking news segment.When O Reilly s extra 15 minutes was up, Smith s time ended, and Tucker Carlson s show started right on cue, with no mention of what happened to O Reilly, and no explanation.Hopefully, this is a sign that Bill O Reilly is on his way out at Fox, and his toxic message will poison the airwaves no more.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 7, 2017"
 Federal Judge Just Gave Attorney General Jeff Sessions A Huge F*ck You,"A federal judge just proudly gave Jeff Sessions the middle finger by approving Baltimore s police reforms even after the attorney general had voiced his opposition.The Justice Department began investigating the Baltimore Police Department in 2014 after news reports that they had paid out millions to settle upwards of 100 lawsuits over police brutality and misconduct. Following the death of Freddie Gray in 2015, the investigation intensified. The DOJ, which was still under former President Obama at the time, found widespread unconstitutional and discriminatory practices.Mother Jones reports:  Earlier this week, Sessions ordered a review of all consent decrees between police departments and the Justice Department. Department lawyers asked the US district court in Baltimore to put off approving the consent decree for at least 30 days so the new administration could review it. I have grave concerns that some provisions of this decree will reduce the lawful powers of the police department and result in a less safe city,  Sessions said in a scathing statement.  Make no mistake, Baltimore is facing a violent crime crisis. On Friday, US District Judge James Bredar told Sessions to go to hell, informing him that  the time for negotiating the agreement is over. The case is no longer in a phase where any party is unilaterally entitled to reconsider the terms of the settlement; the parties are bound to each other by their prior agreement,  Bredar wrote.  The time for negotiating the agreement is over. The only question now is whether the Court needs more time to consider the proposed decree. It does not. According to Sessions, the agreement was put together in a rush at the very end of Obama s presidency and it looks like he is right. The final report was issued last summer but after Trump was elected, officials reportedly scrambled to get everything finalized, and for good reason. Because they managed to complete this particular task before Obama left office, Sessions  hands are now tied.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 7, 2017"
 Syria Is EXACTLY What Noam Chomsky Warned Us About A Week Ago,"Donald Trump decided to bomb Syria on Wednesday in response to a chemical attack on the Syrian people. Watching the new reports, I couldn t help but think of an article I wrote just last week about a warning from Noam Chomsky that now looks like more of a prediction.In an interview with Alternet, Chomsky said that if Trump s approval ratings continue to plummet we should be ready for  the possibility that there would be some kind of staged or alleged terrorist act, which can change the country instantly. To be clear, by  staged or alleged terrorist attack,  Chomsky doesn t necessarily mean fake. Speaking to Truthout just days later, the noted scholar explained that Trump could simply take advantage of the situation should an attack occur and  exploit it. If that happens, we can expect that the Trump-Bannon crowd will seek to divert attention in one of the many familiar ways   perhaps conjuring up some threat to American security (or if there is one, exploiting it). Or, perhaps, scapegoating the most vulnerable: immigrants, Muslims, welfare recipients (one of Reagan s disgusting techniques), and other available targets,  Chomsky explained.  That could turn very ugly. It could lead to the  friendly fascism  that sociologist Bertram Gross predicted 30 years ago. Or worse. And then comes Syria. While we are still sorting out all the details, one thing is for certain: Trump doesn t give a damn about Syrian babies. If he was worried about these people, he wouldn t have tried repeatedly to stop all Syrian refugees from entering the country as part of his bigoted Muslim ban.So, if Trump didn t decide to bomb Syria because he was  heartbroken and outraged  over the deaths of these  beautiful babies,  why would he do it? Simple. Chomsky already answered this question. He did it because nothing galvanizes a country and boosts approval ratings like a war. And it s working.Naturally, Trump s supporters think bombing Syria was the greatest way ever to show the world who has the biggest   ahem   hands. But even Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are backing the move. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have both staunchly opposed Trump since the very beginning, are applauding Trump s retaliation against Assad as well.Trump s actions in Syria also provide another golden opportunity. Trump and Russia get to pretend they re mad at each other. And, of course, that will totally prove that they weren t colluding to steal the presidential election.It is also worth noting that Trump s airstrikes were largely a publicity stunt. Trump warned Russia of the impending attack about an hour before the first bombs started flying. And according to ABC, Russia warned Assad. As a result, most of the equipment and personnel held at the target air base were gone by the time the assault actually began.This is exactly what Chomsky warned us about a week ago. Trump looked at the atrocities taking place in Syria and saw a way to boost his popularity because he s desperate. It s all so transparent, it s sickening.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"April 7, 2017"
 Person Majority Of Americans Voted For SHREDS Incompetent Fool Over Syria Actions (VIDEO),"It can easily be said that Donald Trump has absolutely no idea what he is doing in regards to policy both domestic and foreign. He s a blundering fool who belongs nowhere near the Oval Office, and maybe he knows this considering how much time he spends away from it at his resorts.While many are commenting on the order given by Trump to deliver airstrikes on a Syrian airbase, one person who knows probably more than anyone about geopolitics weighed in with their opinion. That person is former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Clinton actually agreed that action needed to be taken and hours before Trump gave the order, she suggested hitting Syrian airfields. She said: I really believe that we should have and still should take out his air fields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them. However, Trump s strikes were ineffective at stopping anything, and unlike the *president, Clinton actually knows that a plan of follow up action needs to take place. She also knows that Trump can t say he cares about the slaughter of innocent children, but then also deny them refuge in the United States. It s hypocritical, to say the least.While speaking at the Women in the World conference in Texas, Clinton said: I hope this administration will move forward in a way that is both strategic and consistent with our values   And I also hope that they will recognize that we cannot in one breath speak of protecting Syrian babies and in the next close America s doors to them. And she is absolutely correct. Trump s move in Syria was purely symbolic. It was posturing and it did nothing but provide a different narrative for the news to talk about other than Russia helping Trump get elected.It s going to be up to Trump to move forward with an actual plan of action with Syria, but don t hold your breath.Watch Hillary Clinton show what true leadership looks like here:Hillary Clinton: US cannot, in one breath, speak of protecting Syrian babies and close America s doors to them https://t.co/QLRmvvoVHv pic.twitter.com/FPNms0NBkQ  CNN (@CNN) April 7, 2017Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"April 7, 2017"
 Syrian Air Base Trump Spent $80 Million Attacking Yesterday Already Up And On Bombing Raids Again,"The Syrian air base Trump spent $80 million bombing yesterday is reportedly back in business. It s been less than 24 hours.According to Syrian human rights observers, warplanes were seen using the airbase as part of their attacks on anti-government forces near Homs.Reuters:Syrian warplanes took off from an air base which was hit by U.S. cruise missiles on Friday, and carried out air strikes on rebel-held areas in the eastern Homs countryside, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.Trump received praise from right-wing politicians and media pundits giddy at the idea of another war for his  decisive  blow to the Syrian regime. Instead, it appears the attack did very little to undermine Assad s military.It did, however, escalate tensions in the region and inflame military posturing from Iran and Russia. According to Russian officials, the country will begin shipping anti-aircraft weapons into Syria in direct response to Trump s attack. A Russian war ship has also positioned itself near the two U.S. vessels responsible for firing the tomahawk missiles into Syria.Trump s attack on the Syrian air base had a staggering price tag. The guy who claimed America couldn t afford to pay for Meals on Wheels spent an estimated $60-80 million on the rockets alone. The entire cost for the military action is likely much higher.The attack itself was largely an empty gesture   provocative but meaningless. Trump warned Russia ahead of time (in order to allow Russian soldiers to leave the battlefield). The Russians tipped off the Syrians, who also evacuated before the first missile touched down. One estimate put the death toll at eight. It s not entirely clear if the real number is even that high.As for Trump, his motivation seemed clear: Publicity. A few years ago, Trump even hinted that this might be his response to sagging approval numbers when he projected his own insecurities onto then president Obama.Now that Obama s poll numbers are in tailspin   watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.

According to his followers, Trump fell for it, hook, line and sinker. Or, he was lying to them all along.The Trump of weeks past was firmly against any action in Syria. He even accused President Obama of wanting to wage war in Syria over falling poll numbers.

 The White House Just Confessed The REAL Reason For Syria Attack; It Is DISGUSTING (DETAILS),"While many have been baffled and upset by Donald Trump s reckless decision to attack Syria (without Congressional approval), the inner details of what drove Trump to make such a decision are even worse.Senior White House officials have just confessed that this attack against Syria was nothing more than a publicity stunt for Trump, to feed his out of control ego. According to those officials, the poorly planned missile strike (which ultimately failed) isn t even part of a broader strategy or a step in a larger plan to remove Assad. It was absolutely meaningless, and its only purpose was to make Trump seem like a strong leader.CNN s Jim Acosta reported:While it s not surprising that Trump has no strategy for Syria (let s face it, he has zero strategy for anything he does), it s terrifying to actually see it play out before our eyes as an incompetent president puts America in grave danger.Basically, Trump used the U.S. military to make it LOOK like he was taking some sort of action on Syria, when really the exact opposite is true. There is no plan, and there likely will never be one. What Trump put on last night was merely a performance   and a damaging one. Already, U.S.-Russia relations have grown more tense as Russia is making moves to punish America for Trump s carelessness.The message Trump is sending to the world is terrifying   what we can expect during Trump s presidency is a show; just big empty gestures that won t actually carry any weight. Trump has basically shown Assad that he s not really going to do anything besides send 50 missiles his way. Now Assad   and the rest of the world   knows our president is all talk and almost no action. The strength and leadership that America once had in the world is disintegrating quickly.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"April 7, 2017"
 Syrian Military Knew Missile Attack Was Coming After Trump Told Putin About It,"Donald Trump s bromance with Vladimir Putin seems to be going the way of most middle school  relationships.  Though the Russian dictator was perfectly happy to employ a team of hackers to dig into The Donald s opponents at his request and propagandists to spread fake stories about his opponents, Mr. 45 s attack on Syria was too much for the guy who is known for killing unfriendly journalists and political opponents.CNN reported that Trump s team called Russia to warn them of the airstrike in advance   and according to ABC, the Syrian army seemed to know the attack was coming, allowing them to evacuate equipment and personnel:Syrian military officials appeared to anticipate Thursday night s raid on Syria s Shayrat air base, evacuating personnel and moving equipment ahead of the strike, according to an eyewitness.Dozens of Tomahawk missiles struck the air base near Homs, damaging runways, towers and traffic control buildings, a local resident and human rights activist living near the air base told ABC News via an interpreter.Let s look at what happened here: Trump warned Putin of an attack because his people were in the area. Mysteriously, the targets learned of the incoming Tomahawk missiles and were able to evacuate people and equipment.Interesting, eh?Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"April 7, 2017"
 Trump Tried Recreating Obama’s Iconic ‘Bin Laden Raid’ Situation Room Photo – And It’s So Pathetic,"For months now people close to Trump have been privately saying the president is consumed by a seething jealousy of his predecessor, Barack Obama. Where Trump s approval ratings continue to circle the drain, Obama s have seen a post-presidency surge. Adding to that, Obama s signature piece of legislation is not only more popular than ever, but the replacement Trump came up with imploded before it even got a vote. In the media and from political observers Obama is viewed as smarter, more mature, and more gifted politically than Trump. And Trump knows it.So what is Trump to do? Imitate.Hours after he ordered a missile strike in Syria, Trump s press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted an image of the situation room.WH photo (ed for security): @potus receives briefing on #syria military strike fr Nat Security team, inc @vp , SECDEF, CJCS via secure VTC pic.twitter.com/aaCnR7xomR  Sean Spicer (@PressSec) April 7, 2017It bore a disturbing resemblance to one of the most famous photographs of Obama s time in office, the night he ordered the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden.However, unlike Obama s image   filled with serious people doing serious jobs   Trump s version contains a number of unqualified goons. The photograph of Obama and his staff signaled strength. Trump s imitation serves only to show the world what a clown show Trump s White House is.Trump s attack on Syria may have earned praise by right-wingers, but it s already escalating tensions in the region and may someday be viewed as the opening shot in a devastating global war. Russia, rather than cave to Trump s show of  strength  has vowed to arm the Syrian regime with more anti-aircraft weapons meant to shoot down any U.S. plane that crosses the border.BREAKING Russian military says it will help Syria strengthen its air defenses after US strike.  The Associated Press (@AP) April 7, 2017The attack also alienated Iran, pushing them further into the sphere of Russia and the Assad government.Those are some serious consequences for actions being made by Rex Tillerson, a former oil executive with ties to Russia; Steve Bannon, the owner of white nationalist website Breitbart; and Jared Kushner, the son of a real estate mogul who married the daughter of a real estate mogul. The fact that those men are even in the room is a disgrace to America s military, who will likely carry the brunt of the consequences.But perhaps the biggest joke in the room is that Donald Trump himself.

 Weird: Republicans Were Against Obama Launching A Strike On Syria But Not Now (DETAILS),"A U.S. official said that the Russians were warned before the U.S. launched at least 59 tomahawk missiles aimed at Syria at Donald Trump s orders, but the alleged president did not seek Congressional approval. Trump was reportedly affected by the pictures of children who were harmed or killed after a deadly gas was unleashed on civilians, but oddly, the former reality show star was never disturbed by the pictures of Syrian refugees fleeing from terror at the hands of ISIS.Trump was not in The Situation Room when addressing the strikes. He was at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort again. Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,  Trump said of the chemical attack.  It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror. However, Trump opposed President Barack Obama s attempt to strike when a sarin nerve gas attack left more than 1,400 dead outside of Damascus in 2013.Trump tweeted at the time,  What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval. What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2013In contrast to Trump s move on Syria last night, Obama went to Congress to get approval to strike, but the majority of Republicans opposed him. In the newest attack under Trump s administration, 70 died from the gas attack. Again, over 1,400 were left dead in 2013.ThinkProgress reported at the time that 183 Republicans were against bombing Syria. Only 12 Republicans, and that includes then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), sided with the Obama to launch a strike. In the end, Obama decided to postpone the vote since Congress was strongly opposed to the strike with 243 Congressional members seemingly deciding  towards voting  No. The Huffington Post reports:Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) was one of the members of Congress who was against Obama s plan. But he didn t seem to have much to say in response to the news of Trump s strike. God bless the USA!,  Chaffetz tweeted.God bless the USA!  Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) April 7, 2017Weird, because before an attack, other religious extremists would shout,  Allahu Akbar!

" Ivanka Trump Tweets About Dead Syrian Children, And Twitter Has The PERFECT Response (TWEETS)","Ivanka Trump s father, the man who calls himself President of the United States, obviously follows world events even if it seems like he follows them so he can exploit them. His children, Ivanka included, tend to either follow him or walk in lockstep with him on virtually everything.

 WATCH: Colbert’s Takedown Of ‘Cuck’ Steve Bannon Is Nothing Short Of BRILLIANT,"By now, everyone knows that the Jared Kushner vs. Stephen K. Bannon infighting in the White House is coming to a head. It has resulted in the removal of Bannon from the National Security Council. Apparently, Kushner had a hand in getting Bannon s hands off our national security, so, for this one, go Jared. We now have a much more secure nation, thanks to his removal. One person who couldn t wait to mock the white nationalist s takedown by his own was Late Show host Stephen Colbert.Colbert started that part of his monologue by mocking Bannon s resistance to being taken off the NSC, saying: Today we re learning more about a huge event yesterday when Steve Bannon was removed from the National Security Council. It s so nice to have Bannon fans here to night. They re so rare, so rare. It was not easy to remove Bannon. They held a hot match to his back until he released his pincers. And, they think the head might still be in there. He might get an infection. Colbert then went on to express disbelief that this was not a demotion: I m not sure if he accomplished his goal. There are still some Muslims in America. There s still some, right? Can you check on that? Still a couple.Word on the street is that Jared Kushner helped push Bannon out. How many jobs does that kid have? I m not sure I m surprised by this. I m not surprised at all in fact, because there is known friction between these two.Whenever Kushner s not around, Bannon calls him a  cuck.  And Bannon tried to stop the demotion, threatening at one point to quit if it went forward. Wait, wait a second, Steve Bannon, you threatened to quit if you got kicked off the National Security Council? Then you got kicked off and you didn t quit? That s a TCM, bro! TOTAL CUCK MOVE! This is absolutely brilliant. There is so much goodness in that clip, that it has to be watched repeatedly to be fully appreciated.Watch below via The Late Show Twitter:Tonight: Steve Bannon, forced off the NSC by White House rival Jared Kushner, commits what some are calling a 'TCM.' #LSSC #TCM pic.twitter.com/AllTUQt2aI  The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) April 7, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 7, 2017"
 BREAKING: C.I.A. Knew Russia Wanted Trump WAY Before Election; NOTHING Was Done (DETAILS),"We already knew that Russia wanted Donald Trump to be president and interfered with the election, but new information has just been revealed showing that not only was the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) aware of this, but they were in the know as early as August of 2016. That s well before anything was revealed to the public.According to the New York Times: The C.I.A. told senior lawmakers in classified briefings last summer that it had information indicating that Russia was working to help elect Donald J. Trump president, a finding that did not emerge publicly until after Mr. Trump s victory months later, former government officials say. Further: The former officials said that in late August   10 weeks before the election   John O. Brennan, then the C.I.A. director, was so concerned about increasing evidence of Russia s election meddling that he began a series of urgent, individual briefings for eight top members of Congress, some of them on secure phone lines while they were on their summer break.It is unclear what new intelligence might have prompted the classified briefings. But with concerns growing both internally and publicly at the time about a significant Russian breach of the Democratic National Committee, the C.I.A. began seeing signs of possible connections to the Trump campaign, the officials said. By the final weeks of the campaign, Congress and the intelligence agencies were racing to understand the scope of the Russia threat. Then there s this: The officials said Mr. Brennan also indicated that unnamed advisers to Mr. Trump might be working with the Russians to interfere in the election. So, not only did Russia work to get Trump elected, but those closely connected to Trump may have been working directly with Russia.Here s the thing   if this information was available before the election, and it was well known that not only was Russia trying to influence the election, but Trump advisers may have been talking directly to Russia, why was the election allowed to even go forward? For all intents and purposes, the election should be considered absolutely illegitimate and a new election should be held in light of all this new information.Our democracy and the core of everything we are as a republic has been compromised by a foreign adversary, and NOTHING has been done. This is NOT okay.The public had a right to know this information going into the voting booth, and nothing was said. This is beyond maddening, and someone needs to be held responsible.Featured Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Former SNL Cast Member Breaks Silence On Trump’s EMBARRASSING Behavior At Rehearsal (VIDEO),"A former Saturday Night Live cast member has just spilled the beans about one of Donald Trump s secrets.Taran Killam, who left SNL in 2016, completely destroyed Trump in an interview published in Brooklyn magazine, putting to rest the massive amount of speculation about whether or not Trump actually knows how to read. Apparently, Trump cannot. According to Killam, Trump  struggled  to read even the simple jokes the writers had given him.Trump made an appearance on the show in December 2015, right after he announced he was entering the presidential race. Killam said that particular episode was  not fun  and  most of the cast and writers were not excited to have him there. However, having Trump there taught the cast something interesting about him. During the  table read  prior to the rehearsal, the host of the week is supposed to read through the jokes they re given. Killam said Trump struggled to read at the table read, which did not give many of us great confidence. Didn t get the jokes, really. He s just a man who seems to be powered by bluster. I didn t get the feeling that he was excited to be there. When Killam was asked if Trump was  unpleasant  to work with on the show, Killam said: He was  everything you see. What you see is what you get with him, really. I mean, there was no big reveal. There have been rumors circulating about Trump s inability to read before, and now this confirms it. From Trump s refusal to read through documents in front of people to his tendency to ditch his teleprompter during his speeches, Trump s erratic behavior raised suspicions that he was hiding something. And when you look at a video like the one below, it certainly confirms Killam s confession that Trump is challenged when it comes to literacy.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Russia Probe’s New Leader Disqualified Himself MONTHS Ago With One IDIOTIC Statement,"With Devin Nunes  recusal from the House Intelligence Committee s Russia investigation, the committee needs a new leader, and that new leader is Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas. If that name sounds familiar, it s likely because Conaway made some waves earlier this year by saying something so stupid it should have automatically disqualified him from running this investigation.Conaway is the man who made the ridiculous comparison between Russia s meddling in our election, and Mexican celebrities performing for Hillary Clinton. Oh yes, to Conaway, they are one and the same: Harry Reid and the Democrats brought in Mexican soap opera stars, singers and entertainers who had immense influence in those communities into Las Vegas, to entertain, get out the vote and so forth. Those are foreign actors, foreign people, influencing the vote in Nevada. You don t hear the Democrats screaming and saying one word about that. When he was pressed on whether Mexican performers are really on par with Russian hackers, he said: Sure it is, it s foreign influence. If we re worried about foreign influence, let s have the whole story. Two things, idiot: First, foreign performers aren t working in secret. Second, foreign performers aren t working to obtain and release thousands of internal party documents specifically damaging to one campaign.Foreign performers are more like surrogates belonging to a certain demographic. Foreign hackers are more like spies working to sabotage something.And the man now leading the Russia probe tried to downplay it into nothing by claiming they re the same thing. It was the dumbest thing he could ever have said as next in line for the chairmanship because it proves he s both too partisan to run an investigation that should be as non-partisan as possible, and also that he s just plain too stupid to know what he s doing.Things just got very interesting here, and not in a good way. Can House Republicans offer up anybody capable of running this investigation the way it needs to be run? It s just gotten ridiculous now.Featured image by Lance Cheung, CC BY 2.0 via Flickr",News,"April 6, 2017"
 JUST IN: Man-Child Boasts He’s The Best President EVER; Doesn’t Know How Long He’s Been In Office,"You may not have noticed, but Donald Trump is an egomaniacal narcissist who has no concept of reality. This can be seen in almost every tweet, meltdown and decision that he makes. He has no clue what he s doing and belongs nowhere near the Oval Office.All that being said, he personally thinks he s wonderful and likely believes his sh*t smells like a spring meadow.However, he s also a bit of a dumbass, and all of these Trump qualities perfectly came out in a statement he just made aboard Air Force One overheard by NBC News  reporter Peter Alexander.According to Alexander, Trump said: I think we ve had one of the most successful 13 weeks in the history of the presidency.

So hard to believe, in fact, he doesn t seem to realize it himself.Trump is not only one of the most chaotic forces to ever inhabit the White House, but he s also seemingly equally as divisive and destructive. What about these eleven weeks does he deem a success? If being the best at being the worst is deemed successful, then job well done.At least we know that when no one is around to stroke his ego, he has no problem doing it himself.

" REPORT: Bannon Routinely Using Anti-Semitic Slur Towards Jared Kushner, WH Turning Toxic Quickly","Trump s inability to hire experienced, serious individuals to staff his White House has started to rot from the inside out. The group of men surrounding Trump on a day-to-day basis are fringe racists, incompetent liars, yes-men, goons, and at least one member of a Nazi alliance organization overseas. It s less  team of rivals and more dysfunctional group culled from the comment section at Breitbart.Worse still, Trump s two closest advisors   son-in-law Jared Kushner and former Breitbart owner Steve Bannon   reportedly despise each other, fighting  non-stop,  according to sources within the White House.Unfortunately for the dignity of the office, Trump s decision to hire white nationalist Steve Bannon to be his go-to guy is coming back to haunt him. Bannon has taken to using two disgusting phrases to refer to Kushner:  cuck  and  globalist. The word  cuck  is frequently flung around in fringe right-wing white nationalist circles and originates from  cuckhold  meant to denote emasculation. In more modern times, the term is often used by racists to describe a white woman cheating on her white husband with a black man. Bannon apparently can t stop using it in reference to Kushner. [Steve] recently vented to us about Jared being a  globalist  and a  cuck He actually said  cuck,  as in  cuckservative,  the administration official told The Daily Beast. Cuckservative,  a portmanteau of  cuckold  and  conservative,  has become a favorite slur on the right, used like a sexually and racially charged version of  RINO,  a Republican In Name Only.His other favorite is  globalist,  a term often used by white nationalists and neo-Nazi groups to mean  Jewish.  The term is considered a two-for-one slur within the right-wing community. Its origins in anti-Semitism is accented by its nativism. Here s how Daily Beast s Asawin Suebsaeng put it: Globalist  is a term typically used by nationalist, pro-Trump right-wingers against political opponents; however, the term has also come under fire for at times carrying anti-Semitic tones. (Kushner is Jewish.)The use of  globalism  as a stand-in for  Jewish  is well documented and seems to be particularly entrenched in minds of some Trump voters. Forward magazine did an excellent piece on why that is.For Bannon, Kushner represents  interests  outside of white America. Anyone outside Trump s White House probably isn t surprised what that means. Bannon is a long-time anti-Semite. According to testimony by his wife, he once vetoed sending his children to a particular school because he thought there were too many Jewish children there. Working shoulder-to-shoulder with Kushner is apparently too much for Bannon to handle and he s acting out.By the way, Bannon calling Kushner a  globalist  is reminiscent of when folks call Obama a  Muslim.  Just say the word you mean, man.  Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) April 6, 2017It seems that screaming  cuck  and  globalist  isn t winning him any arguments, even within Trump s administration. He recently got yanked for his position on the National Security Council   a spot he had no business occupying in the first place. In a clear humiliation, Bannon reportedly said he would resign if Trump dared pull him from the council. Trump called his bluff and Bannon blinked. But he s likely not forgotten the slight. Trump s White House is more toxic than ever.Sources have been leaking details non-stop and the picture is ugly. Pence hates Priebus. Trump hates Priebus. Trump hates Spicer. Spicer hates himself. Kushner hates Bannon. Bannon hates Kushner. Trump s new National Security Advisor hates Trump and everyone else in the White House. It s a circus.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Nunes’ Replacement In Trump Investigation Defended Russian Hackers And Putin,"The new leader of what can laughably be called an  investigation  into the Trump Team s collusion with Russia to undermine our democracy makes disgraced House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes look almost sane.When he recused himself (temporarily) from the investigation after he became the subject of his own congressional ethics investigation for releasing classified information in an effort to help Donald Trump, Nunes handed off his duties to Texas Republican Rep. Mike Conaway, whose own views on the Russia situation are, well, let s just say they would make Putin happy.When FBI Director James Comey testified last month, Conaway unleashed a weird defense of Putin, comparing his support of Donald Trump   which has been verified by 17 intelligence agencies   to football of all things. That might work on Saturday afternoon when my wife s (Texas Tech) Red Raiders are playing the Texas Longhorns,  Conaway said.  She really like the Red Raiders. But all the rest of the time   the logic is that because he really didn t like candidate Clinton, it automatically [meant he] liked Trump,  Conway told a befuddled-looking Comney That assessment s based on what? Some levity in the #RussiaIntelHearing   Watch this #YogiBerra exchange between Rep. Mike Conaway and Director Comey! #WhosOnFirst pic.twitter.com/UUSlTGxjnG  Justice&Mercy (@JRDarius1) March 20, 2017He also defended the hackers in an interview with the Dallas Morning News, where he proclaimed that Russia hacking Trump s political opponents after Trump promised they would be rewarded is just like when Democrats hire foreign performers at campaign events: Harry Reid and the Democrats brought in Mexican soap opera stars, singers and entertainers who had immense influence in those communities into Las Vegas, to entertain, get out the vote and so forth. Those are foreign actors, foreign people, influencing the vote in Nevada. You don t hear the Democrats screaming and saying one word about that. Asked whether that is the same as Russia interfering in our election, Conaway didn t back down: Sure it is, it s foreign influence. If we re worried about foreign influence, let s have the whole story. Assisting Conaway will be Trey Gowdy, who recently found himself the subject of an ethics complaint for accepting donations from anti-Clinton groups while he was investigating her and Tom Rooney, who very vocally opposed Clinton.Something tells me these guys won t be taking this seriously.Featured image via Getty Images (Mark Wilson)/screengrab",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Elijah Cummings Called Trump Out To His Face And Here’s The Pathetic Way Trump Tried To Spin It,"Buried in Trump s bonkers interview with New York Times reporters Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush is this outrageous exchange Trump claims happened recently:TRUMP: [U.S. Representative] Elijah Cummings was in my office and he said,  You will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country. HABERMAN: Really?TRUMP: And then he went out and I watched him on television yesterday and I said,  Was that the same man? Which  would have been odd considering Cummings, a fiery Democratic congressman, has been one of Trump s most intense critics. He s very public about it. Cummings has been outspoken about Trump s disturbing connections to Russia, the GOP s botched attempts to cover those connections up, and has repeatedly demanded Trump divest himself of his numerous conflicts of interest. He hardly sounds like a person who has looked at Trump s trainwreck first three months in office and concluded that he deserves to be up on Mount Rushmore.One theory was that Trump flatly lied. Always a possibility   Trump is a pathological liar. Another, suggested by writer Jamelle Bouie, is that Trump mixed up two black men, conflating Cummings with some other guy. Another strong possibility   Trump has shown a complete lack of interest in the lives of black Americans.Fortunately, Cummings came in to provide the real answer: Trump took a criticism Cummings has made to his face and filtered it through his unchecked narcissism. Here s how Cummings describes the meeting Trump said was about praising him: During my meeting with the president and on several occasions since then, I have said repeatedly that he could be a great president if   if   he takes steps to truly represent all Americans rather than continuing on the divisive and harmful path he is currently on. Note the jab that Trump completely missed? IF Trump stops being  divisive and harmful  he could someday be a great president. So far he has not done so. Hasn t even tried. (As if to underscore how little Trump has tried to stop being divisive, in the same interview he defended Bill O Reilly for sexually harassing women at Fox News.)Unintentionally, Trump s bizarre retelling of what went down during his meeting with Cummings exemplifies the warped way Trump sees the world. A criticism turns into praise, stripping away all context in the process. It may explain, for example, why Trump seems to genuinely believe he saw Muslim Americans celebrating on 9/11. His ego filters everything, facts get distorted and retooled for his own agenda.The fact that we have a president who does not seem to understand the difference between reality and the fantasy world that exists in his head is a recipe for disaster. If meetings with a congressman get this distorted, what other delusions is Trump living in?Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Trump Stooge Devin Nunes Hands Investigation To Others As Ethics Committee Investigates Him,"Donald Trump just lost another minion.GOP Rep. Devin Nunes has been in Trump s pocket since the election in November. He was part of Trump s transition team, and as chair of the House Intelligence Committee, he has been desperately trying to help Trump get out from under his Russia scandal.To that end, Nunes went to the White House in secret to inform Trump on the investigation. While there, he was fed a new line of attack to use in a pathetic effort to somehow prove that Trump was right about President Obama wiretapping him.Nunes failed to tell his colleagues on the intelligence committee and hastily set up a press conference. Nunes was later forced to admit that his  proof  was not proof at all.Complaints have been flowing to the Office of Congressional Ethics ever since, and Nunes has been repeatedly called upon to recuse himself from the ever-deepening Russia scandal investigation. Now the House Ethics Committee is starting an investigation of Nunes. So Nunes is stepping aside and handing the investigation over to other Republicans on the intelligence committee.Of course, Nunes channeled Trump by blaming the charges on everyone but himself. Several left-wing activists have filed complaints against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics,  Nunes said in a statement.  The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power. As noted above, the House Ethics Committee is now involved and that s bad news for Nunes and Trump.The committee is comprised of an equal number of Republicans and Democrats, which means Republicans can t just intervene to save Nunes. The committee can subpoena him and force him to testify under oath.Lying to the committee would constitute perjury and demonstrate that Nunes is working for Trump instead of doing his job.Nunes will have to explain why he wen t to the White House in secret late at night to discuss the investigation, and why he released classified information to the public without discussing the information with his colleagues first.As it turns out, the information Nunes received from Trump is the fact that some Trump officials were caught on surveillance of foreign agents. Nunes and Trump want us all to believe that the information vindicates Trump s accusation against President Obama.Except that the surveillance did not target Trump and his team at all   it targeted the foreign agents they just happened to be meeting with. And Trump clearly accused President Obama of wiretapping him specifically.Clearly, Nunes and Trump are working together to help him wriggle his way out of answering for the Russia scandal that has only become more explosive and damning. Now we just have to wait and see if Trey Gowdy investigates Trump s Russia scandal with the same doggedness he displayed during his investigation of Benghazi. Because if not, it s proof that Republicans are incapable of policing themselves.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
" Steve Bannon THREATENS Trump Over Removal From National Security Council, Administration In CHAOS","Yesterday, the Trump administration delivered a bombshell that no one saw coming   that former Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon, who is now serving as Trump s White House strategist, was being kicked off the National Security Council. While Bannon released a statement that seemed neutral enough, it turns out that s not how he really feels at all   and Trump is in trouble.According to a new report by the New York Times, Bannon aggressively disagreed with the decision to demote him. In fact, he was apparently so pissed off over being booted off the council that he even threatened to completely leave his position in the administration. The Times wrote: Mr. Bannon resisted the move, even threatening at one point to quit if it went forward, according to a White House official who, like others, insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Mr. Bannon s camp denied that he had threatened to resign and spent the day spreading the word that the shift was a natural evolution, not a signal of any diminution of his outsize influence. Considering the fact that Bannon did not show up at Trump s press conference with Jordan s King Abdullah II, some bitterness on Bannon s part makes absolute sense.Bannon s position on the National Security Council has been controversial to begin with   it was a role he basically tricked Trump into giving him. Trump had signed off on an executive order without actually knowing what it said   and later got upset that he d accidentally and unknowingly given Bannon a position that he probably wasn t meant to have. Bannon had no relevant experience for a position on the National Security Council, but we all know that s hardly a prerequisite for a job in the Trump administration. Unfortunately for Trump, the White House is crumbling due to its own erratic, inexperienced staff.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Even Trump’s Homeland Security Chief Thinks He’s Full Of Sh*t About The Border Wall,"While campaigning, Donald Trump vowed to build a  great wall  and Mexico will pay for it.  I will build a great wall   and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me   and I ll build them very inexpensively,  the former reality show star said at the time.  I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.  Well, that s not going to happen. Mexico is not paying for the wall and Trump s own homeland security secretary disagrees with the amateur president.Kelly said Wednesday that it is doubtful that a wall along the full border with Mexico would ever be built, despite Trump s claims. It is unlikely that we will build a wall from sea to shining sea,  Kelly told senators on the Homeland Security Committee, according to The New York Times.Instead, Kelly, who was appointed by Trump said the department will look to build physical barriers. That includes fencing and concrete walls in places that make sense.Like his presidency and administration, Trump s plan for the  great wall  is amateurish and chaotic.In February, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a border-state Republican, said that building a physical wall along the border in some places  makes no sense. There are other Republicans who were left scratching their heads, too, over Trump s nonsensical border wall.  I don t think we re just going to be able to solve border security with a physical barrier because people can come under, around it and through it,  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said in January.Still yet, Kelly defended Trump s  extreme vetting  proposal in which he insists that children would not be routinely separated from their families unless the  situation at the time requires it,  such as when the mother is sick or addicted to drugs. Right, because if a mother is sick, her children should be taken from her, amirite?It s not just elected officials who are wondering what the hell Trump is thinking. A supporter of the alleged president s found her home suddenly on the Mexico side of the border. We call that karma. Adding to that, Trump wants a 30-foot wall that looks good on the northern side of the border. We re not sure what she was thinking when she cast her vote for Trump. He was very clear in what he said, and as far as his lies go, she was warned by Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Trump s Republican rivals that he s full of sh*t.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Here’s The Veiled Threat Trump Sent CNN Chief After Release Of ‘Grab Them By The Pu**y’ Tape,"There s a reason Trump hates CNN, and it s been obvious for a long time. However, what many may not know is exactly why CNN s negative coverage gets under his skin so badly. It turns out that he believes CNN owes him for putting their current president, Jeff Zucker, in place. When the network released the  Access Hollywood  tapes in which Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women, and then followed that up with increasingly bad coverage, he saw it as an act of betrayal.So he sent Zucker this letter: Jeff   Too bad you (CNN) couldn t be honest with how well I did in the debate. The dumbest thing I ever did was get you the job at CNN   you are the most disloyal person. Just remember, I always seem to find a way to get even. Best wishes, Donald J. Trump. Yep.  You are the most disloyal person.  Trump literally believes that Zucker should reward him with favorable coverage throughout what the rest of his career, or his whole career in politics, or something. Maybe he expected CNN to just ignore all the heinous things he does because he was so awesome to them way back.The hilarious thing is what s happened since. From The New York Times:[T]he only thing better than having Donald Trump on your network is having him attack it. Far from hurting CNN, Trump s war against it has amounted to a form of product placement    earned media,  you could say   giving its anchors and correspondents starring roles in the ongoing political drama, turning them into camera-ready warriors for the First Amendment.In 2016, CNN made nearly $1 billion, which was the network s most profitable year ever. They re on track to beat that for 2017 already, and it s only April. Zucker s on a hiring spree. They re getting some huge scoops. The list of good fortune goes on.So revenge? It s backfired on Trump horrifically.CNN disagrees that Trump s 2012 lobbying had any effect on their decision to give Zucker the top position, and it wouldn t be surprising to find that they re actually telling the truth. Trump is a narcissist who believes he has far more influence over everyone than he does.Featured image by Shawn Thew-Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Seth Meyers SLAMS Trump’s Defense Of ‘State TV’ Fox News And Sexual Deviant Bill O’Reilly (VIDEO),"On Wednesday night s episode of Late Night, host Seth Meyers ripped Trump a new one for his continued support of Fox News and his defense of Bill O Reilly. It s not only despicable that Trump (a known sexual harasser) would defend fellow sexual harasser Bill O Reilly, but he did this less than a week after he proclaimed that April would now be known as  National Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Meyers, not one to ever let Trump get away with anything, dedicated his popular segment A Closer Look to this very subject and it was glorious. At the beginning of the segment, Seth focused on Trump s undying, and equally disturbing love and admiration for Fox News and his favorite programs on the failing network. You probably have at least a passing familiarity with Fox News if you ve ever visited an elderly relative or gotten drunk at a bar in a small-town Applebee s,  he said, introducing the segment,  particularly with one viewer, the president of the United States. He then went on to show pictures of Trump s free Twitter advertisements for Fox and said: The President literally just recommends TV shows now. Instead of a Bible, Trump should have been sworn in on a TV guide. That, of course, drew raucous laughter from the crowd, but it s so true! He cannot stop plugging this network and along with himself, he s made Fox News more of a laughing stock than it was before he was elected! Now, he s coming to O Reilly s defense, which is sure to make things worse for the network who has already lost over 20 advertisers amid the newest sexual harassment scandal they just can t seem to get away from, as much as they ve tried to sweep it under the rug. Soon the only advertisers left on his show are going to be Ivanka Trump s clothing line and Steve Bannon s skin worsener,  Meyers joked.Watch the full segment below:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"April 6, 2017"
 This Amazingly Diverse Book About Santa Claus Will Make Right-Wing Heads Explode,"We all remember the uproar over at Fox News a few years back when the idea of a black Santa Claus came up. In fact, Megyn Kelly was so upset that she had to insist live on the air to all the little children of the world that Santa Claus could only be white. Well, if they were upset by that, they are going to really blow their stacks over the version of Santa Claus being rolled out in a new children s book.Called Santa s Husband, the Harper s Design book portrays Santa as a black man who is also gay. His husband is a white man. The husband also doubles for Santa at malls worldwide, and the book chronicles their happy existence in the North Pole. Aside from the heaping helping of diversity, even better is the fact that the book s author is Daniel Kibblesmith, who writes for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.Kibblesmith says of the concept, and how it all began as a joke with his partner: My fianc e [author Jennifer Wright] and I joked privately, and then on Twitter, that since every house has its own traditions and lore surrounding Christmas, we would tell our child that the black Santa Claus was the  real  Santa. If they saw a white Santa at the mall, we d explain that this was his husband. Kibblesmith also joked about it on Twitter:Me & @JenAshleyWright have decided our future child will only know about Black Santa. If they see a white one we'll say ""That's his husband""  Daniel ""Kibblesmith"" (@kibblesmith) December 3, 2016He then realized that it was something that people were actually interested in, due to the wide interest it generated on Twitter and said he saw  there was genuine interest in this book becoming a reality.  And voila! Santa s Husband was born. As for the racists and homophobes who hate the idea? Kibblesmith simply says,  everything is okay.  He goes on to say: Some people   not me   even believe that Santa Claus is just your parents, which would mean that there are as many interpretations of Santa Claus as there are different kinds of families. But again, this is only a theory, because Santa Claus is real, and we have written a book about him. Lastly, but not least, here is the book s adorable cover:Via Huffington PostThank you so much for writing this book, Mr. Kibblesmith. This is something that has been needed for a very long time. You re right   families come in all kinds of packages, and diversity is a strength, not a weakness.For those interested, Santa s Husband us due out in October. You can follow Daniel Kibblesmith here on Twitter.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
 Trump’s Administration Was Just Caught Up In Prostitution Scandal; Here’s How It Went Down (DETAILS),"While it can be said that no one is immune from punishment, a terrific example of that fact is how a Secret Service agent who was on Mike Pence s detail just got himself arrested.Why was he arrested? For getting caught soliciting sex from a prostitute.According to CNN:  a Secret Service agent on Vice President Mike Pence s detail has been suspended from official duties after meeting a prostitute at a Maryland hotel. One law enforcement source says the agent was caught after police saw him exiting the hotel. Apparently, this is how it all went down: The police responded to a call from the hotel manager who became suspicious of activity in one of the rooms. The source said this was not a sting. Now, even though the agent was off duty and wasn t currently guarding the *vice president, it is still illegal to solicit sex.CNN reports: A Secret Service spokesperson, speaking on the record, acknowledges  an alleged incident  occurred and says it involved an off-duty Secret Service employee and said that the matter is under investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility to determine the facts.According to the spokesperson, the employee was required to surrender his weapon and official gear and was placed on administrative leave. The employee s security clearance and access to all Secret Service facilities has also been suspended. Tsk tsk. You d think someone, especially in the Secret Service, would know better. Especially considering the history of prostitutes with agents in the Secret Service.Who can forget the Colombian prostitute scandal of 2012 when nine Secret Service agents had been discovered bringing hookers back to their rooms?Mike Pence s former Secret Service agent will be disciplined, but it still doesn t look good for the entire United States Secret Service, or the *vice president for that matter. And you can only guess the big guy in the Oval Office doesn t like it. No, not Bannon, the other big guy.(*pending investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election)Featured Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017"
" WATCH: Arnold Schwarzenegger Just BURNED Trump Over ‘The Apprentice,’ And It Is GOLDEN","Back in February, Donald Trump decided he was going to use the White House prayer breakfast to slam Arnold Schwarzenegger and  The Apprentice,  because the show s ratings had tumbled and there can be only one reason for that   His Trumpificence was no longer on the show. Trump asked everyone to pray for Schwarzenegger and his ratings, which he no doubt thought would get under the Terminator s skin.He couldn t have been more wrong. Van Jones just asked Schwarzenegger about this jab on his show,  The Messy Truth.  What Schwarzenegger had to say is absolute gold: It gave me an opportunity to go and shoot back and say, you know, that the show didn t do well because, you know, one-third of the audience left, because they boycotted the show because you re the executive producer, Donald Trump! He went on to say that, if Trump had just been open and honest and told everyone from the get-go that he was the executive producer, they d have had really great ratings!He also took the opportunity to poke Trump over his unconscionably thin skin, saying: I have thick skin.

 BOMBSHELL Report Just Dropped Showing Gorsuch Is A Fraud,"Apparently, original ideas are a liability in the Donald Trump administration. Nearly as many Trumpsters have been accused of plagiarism as weeks he s held in office. Okay, that s a slight exaggeration, but Neil Gorsuch, the man who s about to be rammed into a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, appears to have plagiarized some of his writing.We should have known when Trump s own wife Melania plagiarized part of her Republican National Convention speech from Michelle Obama.Once in office, Trump picked Monica Crowley to head the National Security Council. You got it, she plagiarized her Ph.D. dissertation and the book she published in 2012.Crowley was forced to drop out of contention, but Betsy DeVos is Trump s education secretary and in a move that would get a child kicked out of school, she plagiarized part of the questionnaire she filled out to get the job. Now, it appears, Trump s pick for the Supreme Court is also guilty of plagiarism.Politico obtained several documents that showed several passages of Gorsuch s 2006 book,  The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,  were nearly identical to a 1984 article in the Indiana Law Journal. There were also several other incidents.In the most striking example, Gorsuch, in his book, appears to duplicate sentences from an Indiana Law Journal article written by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma without attributing her. Instead, he uses the same sources that Kuzma used: A 1982 Indiana court ruling that was later sealed, a well-known pediatrics textbook,  Rudolph s Pediatrics,  and a 1983 article in the Bloomington Sunday Herald.Politico reports on documents showing that SCOTUS nominee Neil Gorsuch plagiarized the work of others. Behold: https://t.co/XQnCmd62Ia pic.twitter.com/ooc2TkG2bA  Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) April 5, 2017There s more. Read the Politico article for all the instances.The White House is calling the accusations false: This false attack has been strongly refuted by highly-regarded academic experts, including those who reviewed, professionally examined, and edited Judge Gorsuch s scholarly writings, and even the author of the main piece cited in the false attack,  said White House spokesman Steven Cheung.  There is only one explanation for this baseless, last-second smear of Judge Gorsuch: those desperate to justify the unprecedented filibuster of a well-qualified and mainstream nominee to the Supreme Court. Experts disagree with the White House: Each of the individual incidents constitutes a violation of academic ethics. I ve never seen a college plagiarism code that this would not be in violation of,  said Rebecca Moore Howard, a Syracuse University professor who has written extensively on the issue.Not that it should make much of a difference.

 House Dems Take On Fight For Trump’s Tax Returns With Bold New Move That Will INFURIATE Him,"Trump promised to release his tax returns, and then, as we all remember, made excuse after excuse after excuse not to. With tax reform now on the table, and Trump s plan taking center stage in the White House following the massive failure to repeal the ACA, House Democrats may finally have a way to force him to release his returns: Refuse to even consider tax-reform legislation until after they ve seen his returns.Seriously. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New Jersey, introduced the resolution as a way to discover just how Trump himself will benefit from tax reform before any legislation even makes it out of the committee:BRILLIANT! New Dem bill would delay Trump s tax reform legislation until he releases his tax returns: pic.twitter.com/2USVD4KNBf  Impeach Donald Trump (@Impeach_D_Trump) April 5, 2017When Republicans ask why Trump s tax returns are so important, this is why. Trump is already personally benefiting from the White House. His ideas for tax reform (along with the rest of the GOP s ideas) could be crafted around how it will help him continue to line his pockets.One of the most obvious problems is that Trump s cabinet is full of billionaires, and his tax plan, along with every plan of the GOP s, will amount to hefty tax cuts for the rich and for businesses. They do not help average Americans, who are the people most in need of tax relief.Furthermore, during the campaign, Trump called himself smart for finding ways to avoid paying taxes. Any tax reform he pushes Congress to consider is extremely likely to be of personal benefit to him because that s how he rolls. If it wasn t how he rolled, he would have officially divested of his business interests, he would not allow the government to fund the business trips of his two sons, and he probably would have let us see his returns so the entire country could compare his tax plans to the taxes he currently pays (or doesn t pay).In short, without being able to see his tax returns, President Rich-Bitch can do what he wants with taxes without much more than the standard outcry about tax cuts for the wealthy. Now, the Democrats  plan would allow the House Ways and Means Committee to review his taxes in a closed-door session, so they still wouldn t be truly public. However, if the Congressional committee in charge of taxes knows what s in there, then there s a chance, however slim, that we ll get tax reform that s far fairer than what Trump likely wants.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017"
 WATCH: Adam Schiff Double Dog Dares White House To Let Sally Yates Testify,"Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, just double dog dared the White House to let Sally Yates testify.Speaking to MSNBC s Andrea Mitchell on Wednesday, Schiff said,  the person that is in the best position to talk about the events that led up to his [Mike Flynn s] firing is Sally Yates.  Schiff told Mitchell that he has asked for Yates, who was the acting attorney general until Donald Trump fired her for defying him, to testify on what she told the White House regarding the disgraced former national security adviser s interactions with Russia. She is more than willing to testify, we have asked her to testify, the White House says   at least   publicly   they want her to testify,  Schiff said.  There is a letter sitting on the desk of my chairman that I ve signed, requesting that hearing to be rescheduled, and we are waiting for a response. Yates was scheduled to testify last month but Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), chairman of the committee, suddenly canceled the hearing without warning. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer keeps claiming that Trump wants Yates to testify and Schiff called their bluff on Wednesday. Sean Spicer has said he would like Sally Yates to testify, so let s hold Sean Spicer to his word,  Schiff said.  Let s bring her in and allow her to tell the American people just what led to Michael Flynn s firing and what she may know about any conversation he had with the Russian ambassador on the subject of relief from Obama sanctions on Russia over its intervention to help Donald Trump. According to Schiff, the only thing keeping her from testifying is that Nunes hasn t rescheduled the hearing yet.

 Reporter Reveals The Real Reason Trump Fired Bannon From WH Post And It’s Petty As Hell (VIDEO),"News that one of Trump s closest advisor, Steve Bannon, had been ousted from his position within the National Security Council, only further reinforced the disturbing amount of chaos happening within the White House. People are fired abruptly. People resign abruptly.

In their rush to spin the story, top placed  anonymous sources  all began using the oddly specific word  de-operationalize  to describe Bannon s role suggesting this was a talking point being crafted from the White House itself. The excuse that Bannon was there to watch Michael Flynn is even worse. Trump has repeatedly stood by Flynn, so claiming he wanted Bannon to watch him means he knew Flynn was a crook but put him in the job anyways. Not a good look.What s the real reason Bannon was slapped down? A source close to Trump told White House correspondent John Roberts that Trump had grown increasingly jealous of Bannon sharing his  limelight. We are also told, though, that the president wasn t particularly happy with the way Bannon had been grabbing the limelight and that may have also played into all of this.

 Trump Stands Up For Fellow Sexual Harasser Bill O’Reilly: He Didn’t Do ‘Anything Wrong’,"On March 31, Donald Trump declared April  National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.  On April 5   less than one week later   he said fellow scumbag Bill O Reilly didn t do  anything wrong  when he seemingly sexually harassed a large number of his female staff over the years. But then, Donald Trump himself has been accused of numerous sexual assaults and harassment, so birds of a feather.The New York Times got an exclusive interview with Trump and walked away with two bombshell findings, both awful in their own unique way: First, Trump duped veteran journalists Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush into publishing a slanderous claim that Susan Rice, the former national security adviser under Obama, had committed a crime. That would be a huge story if not for the fact that when asked to produce a single shred of evidence, Trump refused to do so. I think it s going to be the biggest story,  Mr. Trump said in an interview in the Oval Office, declining repeated requests for evidence for his allegations or the names of other Obama administration officials.  It s such an important story for our country and the world. It is one of the big stories of our time. He declined to say if he had personally reviewed new intelligence to bolster his claim but pledged to explain himself  at the right time. And he s currently already nursing several other claims   3 million people illegally voted, Obama illegally wiretapped him   which he has also failed to provide any proof for. Despite these repeated offenses, Habermann and Thrush ran the story as if Trump weren t the biggest bullshitter in the world. That s inexcusable.But Trump wasn t done. After pretending to uncover a major political scandal, Trump moved onto his friend Bill O Reilly. O Reilly is currently embroiled in scandal that may cost him his job after having been exposed as settling at least five sexual harassment lawsuits filed against him from female coworkers. Trump, five days into Sexual Assault and Prevent Month, jumped to his friend s defense. I think he s a person I know well   he is a good person,  said Mr. Trump, who during the interview was surrounded at his desk by a half-dozen of his highest-ranking aides, including the economic adviser Gary Cohn and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, along with Vice President Mike Pence. I think he shouldn t have settled; personally I think he shouldn t have settled,  said Mr. Trump.  Because you should have taken it all the way. I don t think Bill did anything wrong. Here s what Trump considers innocent behavior   locker room talk, if you will   by O Reilly:The women who made allegations against Mr. O Reilly either worked for him or appeared on his show. They have complained about a wide range of behavior, including verbal abuse, lewd comments, unwanted advances and phone calls in which it sounded as if Mr. O Reilly was masturbating, according to documents and interviews.The reporting suggests a pattern: As an influential figure in the newsroom, Mr. O Reilly would create a bond with some women by offering advice and promising to help them professionally. He then would pursue sexual relationships with them, causing some to fear that if they rebuffed him, their careers would stall.Trump, of course, has a large list of his own offenses against women. During the campaign, over a dozen women came forward to recount times he had assaulted or attempted to assault them. Trump himself seemed to back up their claims in a leaked audio recording where he bragged about grabbing and kissing women even without their consent. Other women have also come forward to describe times Trump was sexually demeaning or suggestive to them.To watch Trump and O Reilly, both with histories of abuse, cover for each other is truly nauseating.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017"
" Trump Just Got SHREDDED By A Republican Strategist, Presidency CRUMBLING (TWEETS)","There s nothing odd about Donald Trump getting blasted day in and day out by the media and those who didn t support him in the first place, but the rate at which Trump gets crucified by his own Republican Party is unprecedented.The latest GOPer to take Trump to the woodshed is Republican strategist Rick Wilson, who pretty much obliterated Trump s presidency today.

Pointing out that  Trump s poll numbers suck for a reason,  here s what Wilson had to say about America s undeserving president: Then, Wilson lashed out at the remaining Republicans that are still defending Trump and standing by him despite all of his failures and shortcomings. In a shocking rant attacking conservatives that refuse to see how dangerous and incompetent Trump really is, Wilson continued:  Wilson is 100% right. Trump is NOT presidential material, and he has made very little attempt to actually rise up to the challenge of his new role and responsibilities. His polling numbers alone are the most pathetic we ve ever seen, and many Americans are in complete agreement with what Wilson is saying here.The Republican Party has screwed itself by allowing Trump to succeed. America will remember the GOP as the party forever attached to the least successful, most shameful president the country has ever had. Trump s ties to Russia alone will brand the GOP as the least patriotic political party in existence. The damage Trump has done to the party is irreversible, and Wilson knows it. He s part of the group of Republicans that is increasingly frustrated by what he sees of Trump and the GOP, and clearly, wishes this nightmare would be over already.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017"
 Trump Finally Booted A Certain White Supremacist From The National Security Council,"Months into his presidency, Donald Trump seems to have finally realized that it was probably not the greatest idea to install a prominent white supremacist media guy on the National Security Council. According to Bloomberg White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs, The Donald made a few changes to the Council   most notably Bannon s removal:NEW: Trump National Security Council reorganization:-removed Bannon-downgraded Bossert-elevated Coats and Dunford-McMaster sets agenda.  Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) April 5, 2017According to the White House, Bannon s role on the council was  to look over Gen. Flynn s shoulder    a position that is no longer needed especially after Flynn offered to roll over on his former allies in the Trump administration in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Officials claim Bannon did not attend a single meeting, and that his role is no longer needed now that National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster is in charge.NEW: Bannon's role on NSC was to look over Gen. Flynn's shoulder, a White House official said.He never went to meeting. https://t.co/mWsWjw7Qbk  Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) April 5, 2017Lest the real story here get lost, it s important for us to realize that the White House just admitted to giving someone they could not trust top-level security clearance and access to our nation s secrets   and assigning the white nationalist who used to run Breitbart, which he calls a  platform for the alt-right  ( alt-right  means Nazis), to keep an eye on Flynn s loyalties and actions.The Trump administration says Bannon was also there to  de-operationalize  the NSC from the Susan Rice era. He retails his top-level security clearance.In addition to keeping eye on Flynn, Bannon's role on National Security Council was to ""de-operationalize"" NSC from Susan Rice era, I'm told https://t.co/pCnBb4B06o  Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) April 5, 2017NEW: Bannon's national security clearance was NOT stripped, I'm told. He still has the highest clearance.

 Heroin Addict Trump Voter Sad Now That Donald Is Taking Away His Treatments (VIDEO),"Pennsylvania resident Kurt Farmer was perfectly fine with building a wall to keep brown people out of the country, banning Muslims from entering the United States, and Donald Trump s other horrifying policies, but he (like the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups who backed Trump during the election) also made the mistake of believing that The Donald had his interests as a white man at heart.Unfortunately, as a recovering heroin addict, Farmer is now suffering quite a bit of buyer s remorse after learning that his treatments are going to go bye-bye under Trump. Farmer relies on Medicaid to pay for his recovery treatments, and Trump is currently in the process of trying to gut healthcare for all those dirty poors in the country who act like the Constitution guarantees the right to  life  or something. If I didn t have Medicaid, I wouldn t be able to pay for this,  Farmer told CNN.  I would like to say I wouldn t relapse but the chances are from past experience, if I m not going to treatment, in a matter of a few weeks I start getting high. Farmer recently learned   like the rest of us   that the White House intends to allow states to opt out of the Essential Health Benefits regulations under Obamacare   the very same ones that force private insurers and Medicaid to pay for substance abuse recovery.Farmer is the most recent in Trump voters who have lost the faith   but only after learning that they would be hurt by his policies just as much as immigrants, Muslims, and others Trump and his supporters view as Untermensch.This is the difference between conservatives and the rest of us: While we realized The Donald is bad for America as a whole, they waited until he was bad for them to care.Watch the CNN segment below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 5, 2017"
 Trump FURIOUS As Latest Obamacare Numbers Prove It’s Not Going Anywhere (IMAGES),"Donald Trump s approval rating plummeted after his disastrous attempt to get support for his American Health Care Act (Trumpcare) crashed and burned. It was a disastrous health care bill to begin with, proving to be higher in cost while stripping millions of Americans of life-saving health care   and Trump paid for it with his lowest approval ratings yet. Trump is swimming in bad news, but the latest info about the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) is about to make it worse.Apparently, the GOP s effort to do away with Obamacare has created quite the opposite effect   Obamacare is now more popular than it s ever been. Since the bill was signed in 2010, Americans are now more in favor of it than ever before:A new Gallup survey also echoes this monumental change   in the last five months alone, Obamacare approval skyrocketed 13 percentage points, and part of that change has been thanks to the GOP s failure to provide a better solution. The Gallup survey discovered that 55% of America now approves of the Affordable Care Act:Gallup s Jim Norman states that this has big implications for the law   and directly affects what the Republican Party may or may not be able to do in the future. Norman said: If that majority holds, it would be a significant development. Politically, it creates a major obstacle to Trump and Congress  ongoing efforts to change or replace the law. In future elections, it could turn the GOP s opposition to the law from an asset into a liability. More importantly in the daily lives of Americans, it might mean that the most sweeping changes to the nation s healthcare system in decades will remain the law of the land for the foreseeable future. Another poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation discovered that although there was equal opposition and approval for Obamacare, 64% of Americans were pleased that Trumpcare failed because it was obviously far worse. The majority of Americans (61%) are now also holding Trump and the GOP responsible for the future of America s health care, and strongly believe Trump should find a way to improve Obamacare, not repeal it.This information is sure to set Trump on fire, considering how desperate he was to get rid of the bill as soon as he began his role as POTUS. Given the fact that his ideas and agendas are more unpopular than ever, his presidency might be filled with Obama s policies and laws for quite a while.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017"
 WATCH: Louis C.K. NAILS Trump And His Gullible Supporters During Appearance On Colbert,"If Donald Trump was watching The Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night he was probably screaming at the television.Because when comedian Louis C.K. made an appearance on the show he did not hold back when he was asked about the liar in the White House. Sometimes people lie,  That guy lied, they found out he lied.  Then there s somebody who lies because they can t quite stay inside the boundaries of truth,  C.K. began.  Then you have a liar, somebody who it s almost like a problem, they lie a lot. Then you have a lying sack of sh*t,  he continued as the audience became more excited.  That s somebody who just they just lie, they like it, he likes it. He just goes,  Heh heh, that wasn t even true, wasn t even true.  Then I said  they were liars.  It s just insane. It s just gross. He s just a gross, crook, dirty, rotten, lying sack of sh*t, that s how I feel. The audience wildly applauded but Colbert alerted C.K. that there was at least one guy in the crowd who voted for the liar. Louis, there s a guy who voted for him up there,  Colbert said.That s when C.K. noted that Trump voters were duped. Trump voters were hurt the most because Trump lied to them and they believed him. Look if you voted, that s the guy he lied to,  C.K. said.  He didn t lie to me. He lied to him, he didn t lie to me. Everybody else was like  yeah, no that s not true.  But that guy bought it. He s the victim of the lying. Here s the video via Twitter.Tune in tonight to hear #LouisCK explain what kind of liar our President is. #GROSS #CROOK #DIRTY #ROTTEN #LYINGSACKOF  #LSSC pic.twitter.com/mMXbz5ShXA  The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) April 5, 2017And Louis C.K. is absolutely right. Trump is the king of lies, his biggest of which is that he will  make America great again.  His lies about not having any ties to Russia and his lie about President Obama wiretapping him have also been widely covered and debunked. However, Trump continues to repeat them at every turn.A lot of Trump supporters now realize that they made a huge mistake as Trump s policies directly harm them and their families. But again, it s hard to pity a group of people who made such a stupid decision when it was crystal clear that Trump was lying. All they had to do is accept the facts instead of buying Trump s bullshit  alternative facts.  If they had done that, Trump would not be in the White House ruining their lives now.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 5, 2017"
 The FBI’s Russia Investigation Just Took A Turn That Will TERRIFY Trump (DETAILS),"The FBI is doing something with its probe into Russia s interference in our election that should terrify Trump and anybody in his administration, or who worked on his campaign, that has ties to Russia. Put simply, they re creating a special unit dedicated to better coordination of investigation efforts, and to give James Comey better insight into the probe s details.One FBI agent said that  it s meant to surge resources. This looks both like an expansion and streamlining of things. This particular investigation is getting so big that they re starting to have trouble managing it. It s not the first time they ve created a special unit for a high-profile,  sprawling  investigation of this nature. They did it when looking into Wikileaks  release of classified documents, and (because of course) when they were looking into Hillary s emails.It does signify just how seriously the FBI is taking this.There is a growing possibility that Trump or at least high-level members of his campaign colluded with Russia during the election to bring down Hillary Clinton and elevate Trump to the White House. They look so bad that the Obama administration created a document numbering system to personally hand over to the Senate Intelligence Committee to make it harder for Trump and company to hide documents relating to Russia.Trump was dismissive of the intelligence community s findings on Russia s hacking, saying that nobody had any idea who could have done it: It could be Russia, but it could also be China, it could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds. Since then, he s continued to dismiss findings and allegations, refusing to believe either that his buddy Putin would do this, or that the intelligence community could possibly get so close to nailing him for collusion.Either way, the new unit will make the FBI s investigation run more smoothly and efficiently, and it will give Director Comey better knowledge and understanding of what s going on   things that he may have to present to Congress at a later date.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017"
 Lawrence O’Donnell Is Trolling Bill O’Reilly Over His Sexual Harassment Scandals; It’s BRILLIANT (TWEET),"In the age of Donald Trump, it seems that Twitter is ground zero for public spats, public shaming, and all sorts of back and forth exchanges. That is why this is the platform Lawrence O Donnell, host MSNBC s The Last Word, is using to troll Bill O Reilly s reprehensible behavior when it comes to what appears to be years and years of sexually harassing women from his throne over at Fox News.It seems that O Reilly is choosing to actually sue one of his accusers for speaking out, and O Donnell is determined to gin up as much public support as possible for this woman in her most vulnerable hour. He tweeted:O Reilly threatens to sue Wendy Walsh for ""defamation of Mr O'Reilly's character."" Sue me too because I believe her. https://t.co/jQ3y3mUvbM  Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) April 4, 2017That isn t all O Donnell did, either. He tweeted that challenge to O Reilly while he was live on the air Tuesday night, and asked all of his viewers to retweet it, thus showing Bill O Reilly that the game is up, that we know what he did to those women, and that we know that he is bullying, threatening, and intimidating the accuser who is speaking publicly, Wendy Walsh, so that she will shut up.This is what using a public platform for good looks like. Thank you, Lawrence O Donnell, for standing up to the disgusting, misogynistic goon that is Bill O Reilly, and continuing to expose the culture of sexual harassment that is so prevalent at Fox News.",News,"April 4, 2017"
 Members Of Intel Committee Say Russia Scandal Could Result In Jail Time,"Members of the House Intelligence Committee are saying that Donald Trump and his treasonous cronies could find themselves behind bars. Two Democrats on the committee said today that jail time could very likely be the outcome of the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 election and Trump s possible collusion with them.On Tuesday, Rep. Joaquin Castro told CNN s Wolf Blitzer that he  wouldn t be surprised after all of this is said and done, that some people end up in jail.  Blitzer pressed him on whether he  meant not just one individual, but people, plural.  The congressman wouldn t point to anyone in particular but did say  his impression  was that more than one person could find themselves behind bars. You re confident that at least some Trump associates will wind up in jail?  Blitzer sked. If I was betting, I would say yes,  Castro replied.Congressman Denny Heck, another Democrat on the committee, went a step further than Castro during an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday evening while speaking with Chris Matthews. I want to respectfully disagree with my dear friend Joaquin Castro, next to whom I sit on the intelligence committee. He said he would not be surprised if people ended up going to jail. I will be surprised if people don t end up going to jail,  Heck said.Matthews asked about FBI Director James Comey s announcement that a special unit was being formed to handle the investigation of Trump s shady ties with Russia. Heck replied that he was sure  anybody associated with the Trump orbit that was involved in Russia s financial entanglements probably was calling their lawyer today.

 Bill O’Reilly SCREWS Fox News As SHOCKING Amount Of Advertisers Abandon Network (TWEET),"One of Fox News  biggest and most successful news personalities is bringing the network down in a major way.Recently, The O Reilly Factor host Bill O Reilly was exposed for a massive amount of sexual harassment lawsuits that the network settled for him over the span of his career. As Fox has already gained quite the reputation for its sexist culture and tendency to protect its people from sexual harassment allegations, this is damaging enough to the network s reputation   but it s looking like the network will also suffer a big financial hit.So far   and this is just the beginning   as many as 20 advertisers have pulled ads from O Reilly s show over word of the lawsuits. These advertisers include major brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, BMW of North America, Mitsubishi Motors, Lexus, Constant Contact, Bayer, Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, UNTUCKit, Allstate, Esurance, T. Rowe Price, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, Orkin, and Wayfair. And of course, Fox News is trying to sweep this under the rug and pretend that these ad dollars are going to be used elsewhere on Fox. What else would you expect from the most dishonest cable news network?This is really, REALLY bad news for the network. O Reilly was responsible for bringing in over $400 billion in advertisements from 2014-2016 alone. If advertisers are deciding to walk away from O Reilly over these new revelations, this could really hurt Fox News  bottom line.Fox News is already struggling to begin with, as the network has lost almost all credibility for defending and continuing to support Donald Trump. The network has been proven to be highly inaccurate, and Trump has helped to make Fox News a joke when it comes to trustworthy media. O Reilly s recent scandal could be the final straw for the network, as it becomes even less popular than before.Featured image via Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images",News,"April 4, 2017"
 The Trump Administration Just Wrote North Korea Off – Trump Looks WEAKER Than Ever,"North Korea has been launching  intermediate range  ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan for awhile now, and, of course, it would be a good idea for us to have an administration that will actually speak out against this potential threat. Yet the Trump administration, for all Trump s bluster about Obama s  weakness  on Syria, just issued a statement on their latest launch that should make everyone s jaws drop. Rex Tillerson literally just said: North Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile. The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment. ? This is Rex Tillerson s statement on North Korea s missile launch pic.twitter.com/S2xAgZAGlX  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) April 4, 2017That s the best he can come up with? Does Tillerson have no idea what he s doing? Probably not. No, North Korea just fired a missile into the Sea of Japan, which one of our own allies considers a threat. Back in February, they launched a missile into the same area and Trump had a pow-wow over it with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago, prompting tons of questions about the security of the place. Now we have no comment at all.Why?It s possible it s because Trump s both hoping and expecting China to take care of the problem so he doesn t have to. In fact, he sent Chinese president Xi Jinping a message that  the clock has run out on North Korea,  and if they decide not to help,  it won t be good for anyone.  The funny thing is he s all bluster here. He s being a peacock about it and hoping that China will see his feathers and decide it s in their best interests to help us with Pyongyang in ways they ve never done before.And then we won t have to do very much. We can t take unilateral action against North Korea and hope that China will fall in line, because we can t really take such action. China knows that. So what s Tillerson doing here? Making Trump look as weak as rotted wood on North Korea now.But Trump will use a gas attack on innocents in Syria as an excuse to blast Obama for being too weak. Good job being a world leader, Trump. You and Tillerson sure showed them.Featured image by Olivier Douliery-Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 4, 2017"
" Trump Uses Syria Attack To Slam Obama, And Twitter GLEEFULLY Shows The Problem With That (TWEETS)","Most leaders, when they give statements on atrocities happening elsewhere in the world, use the opportunity to condemn those atrocities and pledge some kind of help or solidarity. Not Trump. As he has done in the past, he used a devastating attack in Syria as an opportunity to slam his imaginary enemies   in this case, President Obama.

The whole thing reads:Trump statement on Syria chemical attack brings up Obama s  red line  pic.twitter.com/WUl3GPeYCo  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) April 4, 2017The problem is that Trump repeatedly urged Obama not to engage in Syria at all.

 Fox News Gets Bad News As Advertisers Start Dumping Bill O’Reilly Over Sexual Harassment Pay-Offs,"Fox News is now probably regretting their decision to keep Bill O Reilly instead of Megyn Kelly.Earlier this week, it was revealed that Bill O Reilly and the conservative network have paid off several women to stave off sexual harassment lawsuits.In all, five women have been paid $13 million of what amounts to hush money to stop them from publicly hauling O Reilly s ass to court.For years, O Reilly s behavior toward his female colleagues at Fox has drawn criticism and outrage, especially since he remains employed by the network.O Reilly and Fox previously settled a lawsuit filed by former Fox host Juliet Huddy and a lawsuit filed by Andrea Tantaros is still ongoing. The worst part of my job is being a target for those who would harm me and my employer, the Fox News Channel,  O Reilly pathetically claimed in his defense after the new revelations came to light.O Reilly is trying to portray himself as the victim, but if that were true he would have fought the charges in court to clear his name rather than pay the women off.Fox News recently renewed O Reilly s contract because his show makes the network a lot of money, but that is all changing now because advertisers are dumping O Reilly.According to CNN,Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, BMW of North America, Constant Contact, Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, UNTUCKit and Sanofi are pulling ads from  The O Reilly Factor. In a statement, Hyundai said they would rather seek partnerships with companies that don t condone sexual harassment.We had upcoming advertising spots on the show but are reallocating them due to the recent and disturbing allegations. As a company we seek to partner with companies and programming that share our values of inclusion and diversity. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation as we plan future advertising decisions.Mercedes-Benz said the same thing.The allegations are disturbing and, given the importance of women in every aspect of our business, we don t feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now.In addition, Lexus and Jenny Craig appear to be leaning toward also removing their ads from O Reilly s show since they have condemned sexual harassment and promised to monitor the story as it unfolds.O Reilly may be Fox s cash cow but if more companies pull advertising money from his show they will likely be forced to reexamine his worth to the company. After all, Fox News has spent millions of dollars paying off his victims and paying legal expenses. If the company starts losing millions of dollars from advertisers they ll have to conclude that O Reilly is too much of a financial liability to the company to keep around any longer.And that could finally put an end to the career of one of the most sexist and racist loudmouths in all of cable news history.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 4, 2017"
 Trump’s Son Thinks Batsh*t Crazy Pizzagate Conspiracy Theorist Should Get A Pulitzer,"We can t say enough bad things about rape apologist Mike Cernovich but Donald Trump Jr. thinks he s awesome. Cernovich is a major troll on Twitter and he s also promoted the insane Pizzagate conspiracy theory in which he and other right-wing nutbags allege that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta run a child slave ring in the basement of Comet Ping Pong in Washington, D.C. Oh, by the way, I ve been there and there is no basement in the pizzeria.And then there was the time a comedian made fun of Cernovich on Twitter, so the conspiracy theorist Snowflake retaliated by suggesting that he was a child molester. In a now-deleted tweet, Cernovich wrote,  Have you guys ever tried  raping  a girl without using force? Try it. It s basically impossible. Date rape does not exist.  He also says that black women should be slut-shamed so they won t get AIDS. He s that kind of a guy. He s part of the  Alt-Right  (cough, cough, neo-nazis).Cernovich also circulated the conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson s while offering no evidence to back that up. Quite simply: He s a dick with no balls.Clinton is fading now, she can't last longer than 90 minutes, Parkinson's drugs wearing off. #DebateNight  Mike Cernovich ??

 Trump’s Longtime Friend Larry King Just STUNG Him So Hard He’ll Be Fuming For Weeks,"Larry King has been in the radio and journalism business since 1957 and he s a longtime friend of Donald Trump, so what he just said about him is significant.Trump has taken a ton of criticism since taking office over two months ago, and rightfully so.After all, Trump s scandals continued to stack up and his ineptitude has no end in sight. He opens his mouth when he should keep it shut and he embarrasses himself and this nation with every word he utters and every move he makes. He would rather golf instead of doing his damn job and he appears hell bent on destroying our government. He insults our allies and praises dictators. To make a long story short, Trump has turned America into a laughingstock around the globe.And Larry King put an exclamation point on that fact on Monday during an appearance on Sirius XM s  Tell Me Everything  with host John Fugelsang.King told Fugelsang that Trump s presidency is the  most ridiculous  he s ever seen and went on to slam Trump for appointing people to head departments they want to destroy, specifically referring to Betsy DeVos and Scott Pruitt, who run the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency. It s almost funny,  King began.  To run the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), he hires an anti-environment guy. To run the Secretary of Education, he hires someone who doesn t like education. Doesn t like public schools. That s weird, man. King then further expanded upon his thoughts on the environment by calling out Trump s climate change denial. Trump gets us out of climate change. Who doesn t notice climate change? It s obviously caused by carbon dioxide,  he continued.  To act like it doesn t exist, that s insane. Miami Beach is not going to exist after 2100. Come on. That s climate change. To act like it doesn t exist is insane. I ve got to admit that so far, this is one of the most ridiculous presidencies I ve ever seen,  King concluded.Here s the video via Twitter.

 Women TORCH Ivanka Trump For Celebrating Equal Pay Day After Her Dad Reverses Equal Pay Protection,"Just like her dad, Ivanka Trump s hypocrisy knows no bounds.Donald Trump s daughter pretends to be a great champion for women and women s issues, but the reality is that she is complicit in the harm her daddy is doing to women across the country with his policies.In 2014, President Obama signed an executive order known as the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order.The law required companies that receive federal contracts to enact pay transparency so women can better fight for equal pay and ended the practice of companies forcing female employees into secret arbitration if they file sexual harassment claims.Well, Trump signed yet another executive order on March 27th to reverse that order and he did it quietly.But women definitely noticed, especially on Tuesday as the nation recognizes Equal Pay Day.However, there s not a lot to celebrate this year since Trump s order gives companies the ability to once again hide pay discrepancies from their female employees and force female employees who are sexually harassed or assaulted on the job to remain silent about it.Frankly, it sounds like another women s march on Washington is necessary, but for now, women directed their outrage at Ivanka Trump, who had the gall to celebrate Equal Pay Day on Twitter all while knowing what her father has done.#EqualPayDay is a reminder that women deserve equal pay for equal work. We must work to close the gender pay gap! https://t.co/CcwsoBXWdF  Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) April 4, 2017It s kinda hard to  close the gender pay gap  when Ivanka s own dad is working to widen it.And women were quick to remind Ivanka of that fact..@IvankaTrump you can start by talking to your daddy-boyfriend pic.twitter.com/jPyz4BKiOk  Jess Dweck (@TheDweck) April 4, 2017@IvankaTrump You may need to share with your dad how you feel, he quite obviously doesn t support #EqualPayDay #EqualPayhttps://t.co/UixxN2JDts  ACTIndivisible (@ACTIndivisible) April 4, 2017@IvankaTrump Tell that to your father.

 Inventor Of The Worldwide Web Just DESTROYED Trump’s ‘Disgusting’ Bill To Sell Internet History,"This week, Donald Trump signed a deeply concerning bill that allows internet service providers (ISPs) to sell the browsing histories of their customers to advertisers. It s a disgusting piece of legislation that has Americans around the country concerned for their privacy and has left them feeling vulnerable   and the inventor of the worldwide web himself had some pretty strong feelings toward it as well.Tim Berners-Lee is the computer scientist responsible for the worldwide web we use today. Having seen how much his invention has grown since its creation in 1989, he says he has been  disgusted  by the law Trump just signed in, and has slammed both Trump and the GOP for it in an interview with the Guardian.According to Berners-Lee (and many Americans), user privacy should not be a partisan issue and he was quite shocked that despite facing so much public outcry, the Republican Party rolled this legislation through anyway. Lee said: That bill was a disgusting bill, because when we use the web, we are so vulnerable. Privacy, a core American value, is not a partisan thing. Democrats fight for it and Republicans fight for it, too, maybe even more. So I am very shocked that the Republican party has managed to suggest that it should be trashed; if anyone follows up on this direction there will be a massive pushback   and there must be a massive pushback! Berners-Lee s statement came with a warning as well   he predicted that the Federal Communications Commission would face massive protests if the net neutrality regulations that former President Barack Obama put into place were compromised. He said: If they take away net neutrality, there will have to be a tremendous amount of public debate as well. You can bet there will be public demonstrations if they do try to take it away.

 Trump Voter PANICKING After Realizing Border Wall Will Put Her House In Mexico (VIDEO),"D Ann Loop of Brownsville, Texas lost much of her land ten years ago when the Bush administration decided to put up a border fence that stretched across what used to be much of her property.Loop and her husband found themselves effectively locked out of the United States, as even their home ended up on the Mexico side of the fence. Their only access is a locked gate.The couple fought to keep their land   and lost   in court, placing all of their property on the southern side of the fence   and their nightmare is about to become very real for potentially thousands of people.You see, recently Texans along the border learned that The Donald was forcing them out of their homes for much less than they are worth. If they choose to stay in their homes, some of them have discovered they will soon be living among the criminal hordes down south. I was very angry, I just kept saying, how can they do that? How is that possible in the United States that they can do this?  Loop says.  They put up a fence in front of our land and then keep us in here   lock us in. I didn t understand. I was very   I was floored and flabbergasted. You hear that, folks? Floored and flabbergasted. It left us no property on the U.S. side of the border wall, including my house,  she says.  Everything was behind   on the Mexican side of the U.S. border fence. You punch your code in or you come behind the border wall, there is a feeling of isolation,  her husband, Ray Loop, added.Thousands of land owners   Trump voters and otherwise   along the Texas border will soon find themselves suffering buyer s remorse for the snake oil they purchased from our huckster-in-chief.Trump voter Pat Bell was fine with The Donald until she learned that his stupid wall placed her in danger of living like the Loops. While she opposed the wall because fences and walls don t work (she was fine with the other hatred espoused by Trump and his supporters, of course), she is finding herself negatively impacted by Mr. 45 s policies. Absolutely I would go to the people who are in charge and, you hate to say I would get a lawyer, but if it comes to that issue, you would,  she says.Trump voters are perfectly fine with banning an entire religion from entering the country and building a wall to keep all those dirty brown rapists to the south from entering the country   even gutting social programs   but the second Trump s terrible policies begin to affect them, they will cry about how unfair their lives are.Watch a report on the Loops  predicament below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 4, 2017"
 Dem. Senator Promises To Filibuster Gorsuch Because Of Trump’s ‘Looming’ Impeachment (VIDEO),"Sen. Richard Blumenthal laid all his cards on the table when it comes to Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. The Democratic senator from Connecticut argued that with the  looming  constitutional crisis facing the country and the growing likelihood that Trump will be impeached, Gorsuch should be filibustered.Speaking from the Senate floor on Monday, Blumenthal said that after deliberating carefully and deeply,  he has decided to vote against Gorsuch. He said that although he still harbors resentment over the way Republicans treated former President Obama s SCOTUS nominee, Merrick Garland, that isn t why he will be voting no on Gorsuch. But my vote is not about Merrick Garland. It is about Neil Gorsuch and it is about the constitutional crisis that may well be looming as a potential threat to our democracy. Blumenthal noted the testimony of FBI Director James Comey, reminding his fellow Senators that Trump is being investigated for possibly colluding with Russia to interfere with the 2016 election. This, he explained, makes the Supreme Court more important than ever. The independence of our judicial branch has never been more threatened or more important. The possibility of a Supreme Court needing to enforce a subpoena against the president of the United States is far from idle speculation. It has happened before in United States vs. Nixon. President Trump has launched a campaign of vicious and relentless attacks on the credibility of our judiciary. His disparaging comments have attempted to shake the foundations of respect for judicial rulings, the credibility and trust that is so essential to our Supreme Court and all our courts. And it is a respect that is vital to holding the president himself accountable to the people and our Constitution.The senator added that Trump had promised a  litmus test,  for whatever nominee he chose and as an  acolyte of hard-right special interests,  Gorsuch definitely fits the bill. Because of this, and Gorsuch s evasion of questions regarding civil rights, Blumenthal said he can be expected to attack abortion rights and same-sex marriage, among other things. All reasons he needs to be kept as far away from the bench of the Supreme Court as possible.You can watch Blumenthal explain why he will be voting no on Gorsuch, here:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"April 3, 2017"
 Senate Dems Now Have The Votes To F*ck Gorsuch’s SCOTUS Nomination (DETAILS),"Republicans  pledge to make sure Trump s Supreme Court nominee goes through just hit a little bit of a snag with the disappearance of their filibuster-proof majority.On Tuesday, CBS reported that Democrats managed to gather the necessary 41 votes to ruin Donald Trump and his cohorts  week:The crucial 41st vote came from Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware who announced his decision Monday as the Senate Judiciary Committee met to vote on Gorsuch s nomination.Coons said that he had decided to oppose President Donald Trump s nominee over concerns that include his vague answers in his hearing.Coons  opposition will prevent Republicans from reaching the 60 votes they need to move Gorsuch over procedural hurdles to a final Senate vote.Unfortunately, this doesn t mean that we won t see Gorsuch sitting on the Supreme Court. Republicans are likely to change the Senate rules to allow Gorsuch to be confirmed with a simple majority of 51 votes rather than the current 60 votes needed.So far, two Democrats have betrayed Americans by siding with Republicans   West Virginia s Joe Manchin and North Dakota s Heidi Heitkamp   in supporting Gorsuch s nomination.Things are looking grim for those of us who don t want someone who have proved himself to be the enemy of women and disabled children on the Supreme Court. Keep fighting. Keep making phone calls.We must not allow Donald Trump to destroy the Supreme Court.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"April 3, 2017"
 WATCH: Trump Praises And Shakes Hands With Brutal Dictator After Previously Insulting An Ally,"Donald Trump is not just Vladimir Putin s puppet anymore.When German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the White House, Trump insulted her by refusing to shake her hand. Trump s behavior toward Merkel drew international outrage. Not only did Trump insult Merkel as a woman, he insulted our longtime ally. Germany is a fellow democratic nation that has supported the United States for decades.As we all know, Trump has lavished praise upon Vladimir Putin, complimented North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and even invited Rodrigo Duterte, who has committed human rights atrocities in the Philippines, to the White House to pal around. You gotta give him credit,  Trump once said in clear envy of Kim Jong Un.  How many young guys   he was like 26 or 25 when his father died   take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden   he goes in, he takes over, and he s the boss. It s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn t play games. But Trump went a step further on Monday when he not only met with Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, but also shook his hand twice while being serenaded as  Your Excellency  by el Sisi through a translator.Trump bragged about the United States military and how he is making it even bigger and more expensive, and suggested that Egypt is gong to benefit a lot from it.After singing each other s praises, Trump eagerly shook hands with the dictator without having to be asked and later shook hands again.Clearly, Trump values dictators more than our democratically elected allies.Here s the video via YouTube:Trump has been an admirer of el-Sisi for months and even met with him during the campaign months before Election Day.The Egyptian dictator does not respect human rights and often puts advocates for democracy in prison.This is the kind of leader Trump respects and wants to be friends with and that s a problem that should not be tolerated by the American people.Also, Trump is a complete hypocrite. While Germany pays for their own defense and military, Egypt currently gets $1.5 billion a year from the United States, and you don t see Trump handing el-Sisi a bill for it. Trump certainly isn t demanding that Egypt pay up like he did on Twitter two weeks ago when he falsely accused Germany of owing America money for their defense.Donald Trump s insulting behavior toward our democratic allies and his admiration of dictators is un-American.Featured image via screenshot",News,"April 3, 2017"
 Racist NYPD Cops Threaten To Tase Black Children For Walking Down The Street (VIDEO),"Now that Donald Trump is president and Jeff Sessions is Attorney General, racist cops everywhere have free reign to abuse vulnerable groups of people at every turn. The latest incidence of said abuse was caught on tape by Brooklyn College Associate Professor of Sociology Alex S. Vitale, in which New York City police officers were seen telling a group of black students that they would use a taser on them if they didn t move away from the sidewalk. This is a definite abuse of authority, as the NYPD s official rules state that tasers are not to be used on minors.When the children were slow to move away from the sidewalk at the intersection of Bedford and Campus Avenue, one of the officers said, What are you going to do about it?  This apparently implies that the cops don t care about the children s rights, and would do as they please. A short time later, one cop asks the kids,  do you want to ride the lightning?  This appears to be slang for the use of a taser.Professor Vitale acknowledges that the actions of the officers on the video  seem [s] like an abuse of authority. Well, it certainly was abusive. Those children were not doing anything wrong. These cops are just looking to hurt black children because they can. They should be fired and charged with criminal offenses. Luckily, the kids involved in this incident weren t harmed, but, so many times, kids have wound up hurt or dead because racist, power-abusing cops decided to hurt them.The NYPD says that the actions of the officers on the tape are going to be investigated internally. Of course, that means nothing, because they are investigating themselves. They ll surely find that they have done nothing wrong, even though there is every indication, when one views that tape, that they ve done EVERYTHING wrong.Welcome to  community policing  in the age of Trump.Watch the disturbing video below:",News,"April 3, 2017"
 WATCH: Republican Senator Lashes Out At CNN Hosts After Being Called Out For Supreme Court Hypocrisy,"Republicans are desperately trying to convince everyone that what they did to Merrick Garland was totally normal.On Sunday, Mitch McConnell pathetically defended his party s refusal to hold a confirmation hearing for President Obama s Supreme Court nominee by repeating the claim that it s Senate  tradition  to not confirm nominees during an election year. He also made the childish claim that Republicans did it because Democrats would have done it, even though Democrats have never done such a thing.What Republicans did to Merrick Garland was unprecedented and a total disgrace of the Constitution.But Orrin Hatch picked up where McConnell left off by using the same pathetic defense during an interview on CNN Monday.After being asked about what Republicans will do if Democrats block Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, Hatch whined and accused Democrats of  politicizing  the confirmation process  while pretending that his own party didn t politicize it throughout 2016 when they refused to even grant Garland a hearing. They re politicizing this whole process,  Hatch said.  This is a guy who is a mainstream conservative, which they hate, they don t like that. And of course, they are still upset about my other friend, Merrick Garland. But the Republicans had every right to delay that within a presidential year. CNN host John Berman called out Hatch s hypocrisy. But they look at you and say that s a double standard,  Berman responded.  You call Judge Gorsuch one of the most qualified judges ever to be nominated. Almost everyone said the same thing about Merrick Garland, including you. Indeed, in 2010, Hatch referred to Garland as a  consensus nominee  and said there is  no question  that he would be easily confirmed to the high court if nominated. Garland even complained in support of Garland in 2016 by whining about President Obama s choice before Garland was chosen. The president told me several times he s going to name a moderate [to fill the court vacancy], but I don t believe him. [Obama] could easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man. He probably won t do that because this appointment is about the election. So I m pretty sure he ll name someone the [liberal Democratic base] wants. President Obama made Hatch choke on those words by picking Garland. So there seems to be a double standard where you re saying, it was alright last year when we for political reasons halted the nomination of Merrick Garland,  Berman continued.  But it s not okay this year when Democrats try to halt the nomination of Judge Gorsuch. Hatch responded to Berman by lashing out with a desperate defense of how Republicans behaved in 2016 towards Garland. I ll just tell you straight up, that s total B.S.,  Hatch said.  I can t go back in time and show you any case where in a presidential election year they allowed a Supreme Court justice to be nominated unless both sides agreed. And both sides didn t agree. It was every right of [Majority Leader Mitch McConnell] and Senate Republicans to say we re not going to do this in a presidential year. And at that time, keep in mind, it looked as though Hillary was a sure winner and we would have gotten an even more liberal judge than that one. But that was a stand on principle. Not some new barbaric thing that some have tried to make it. Here s the video via YouTube:Let s make something clear. What Hatch and his fellow Republicans in the Senate did to Merrick Garland was totally unprecedented. They not only rejected Garland after previously praising him, they even refused to grant him a confirmation hearing. That has never happened. Republicans were so unbelievably partisan that Antonin Scalia s body was not even cold yet when they declared that they would refuse to confirm any nominee picked by President Obama. And that brings us yet again to the Republican claim that it s  tradition  for the Senate to not confirm Supreme Court nominees during an election year.That s complete bullshit. As it turns out, the last one occurred only 29 years ago when the Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988 during Ronald Reagan s last year in office.It also happened in 1956 when Dwight Eisenhower nominated William Brennan. The Senate confirmed him despite it being an election year.In 1940, also an election year, Franklin Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the Supreme Court and the Senate confirmed him.So contrary to Republican claims, the tradition is that nominees can be and are confirmed despite whether it s an election year or not.That means Hatch is lying to cover his ass because he knows he and his fellow Republicans are complete hypocrites and now that their hypocrisy is coming back to bite them on the ass they want to play the victim.Featured image via screenshot",News,"April 3, 2017"

Instead, though, Trump s go-to source for information is cable news.Early this morning, Trump lashed out at Hillary Clinton to try to get the public to focus on her instead of his own Russia scandal.  Was the brother of John Podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted? Did Hillary know?  he tweeted just after 6:00 in the morning.The amateur president followed that tweet up with another one, saying,  Did Hillary Clinton ever apologize for receiving the answers to the debate? Just asking! Well, Donald, she isn t the President. Apparently, he doesn t know that. Has Donald apologized for that botched mission in Yemen yet?

 Trump Just Went After China In UNHINGED Rant; America’s Future In FREE FALL (DETAILS),"It wasn t too long ago that Donald Trump deeply offended China by taking a phone call from Taiwan, violating the One China policy. Since then, foreign relations under this new failing presidency have been nothing but chaotic and tense   and unfortunately Trump is just making things worse.Over the weekend, Trump showed everyone that he s learning absolutely nothing about diplomacy, as he sent another  f*ck you  to China. In an interview with the Financial Times published Sunday, Trump warned China that if they don t get North Korea under control, America would step in. Trump said he is  totally  confident that the U.S. could handle North Korea s nuclear weapons program without any help. His words were: If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you. China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won t. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don t it won t be good for anyone. Then, he claimed that he could motivate China to move against the North Koreans, yet failed to clarify: I m not going to tell you. You know, I am not the United States of the past where we tell you where we are going to hit in the Middle East. This interview also had several other insane elements to it, in which Trump continued to defend his lies about former President Barack Obama wiretapping him and insisted that those false claims were  turning out to be true.  However, his comments about China are likely some of the most disturbing to come out of the interview.Trump s timing couldn t be more disastrous, as he is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago club this week   which will likely be another opportunity for Trump to disrespect China and put America at risk.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"April 3, 2017"
 Trump Just Got Ripped APART After Demanding Clinton Apologize For Fake Thing She Didn’t Do (TWEETS),"Donald Trump s desperation to talk about something   anything   that doesn t involve Russia has caused him to lose what was left of his mind, apparently.On Monday morning, The Donald s descent into madness continued as he lashed out at Hillary Clinton.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2017Clinton has not, in fact, apologized for receiving the  answers  (he means questions) for a debate, but she has a good reason   it didn t happen.Trump s claim comes from a fake news story in the Baltimore Gazette, a fake news source.The first presidential debate was held and Hillary Clinton was proclaimed the winner by the media. Indeed Clinton was able to turn in a strong debate performance, but did she do so fairly? Multiple reports and leaked information from inside the Clinton camp claim that the Clinton campaign was given the entire set of debate questions an entire week before the actual debate.Earlier last week an NBC intern was seen hand delivering a package to Clinton s campaign headquarters, according to multiple sources. The package was not given to secretarial staff, as would normally happen, but the intern was instead ushered into the personal office of Clinton campaign manager Robert Mook. Members of the Clinton press corps from several media organizations were in attendance at the time, and a reporter from Fox News recognized the intern, but said he was initially confused because the NBC intern was dressed like a Fed Ex employee.Even though the story is a lie, right-wing websites, Russian trolls, and everyone who hates Hillary Clinton jumped on the opportunity to accuse the former Secretary of State of cheating.He then pushed his insane allegation that President Obama put a  tapp  on his  wires  at Trump Tower..@FoxNews from multiple sources: ""There was electronic surveillance of Trump, and people close to Trump.

 Trump Laughably Claims His Fake Obama Wiretap Claims Are ‘Turning Out To Be True’,"Remember when the world laughed at Donald Trump when he claimed that President Obama put a  tapp  on his  wires  at his gigantic golden tower in New York? Apparently he forgot, because he is still claiming it is true despite multiple intelligence agencies disputing the ridiculous allegation.In an interview with Financial Times, Trump was asked if he regrets any of his tweets   like this one:Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 Now my last tweet, you know the one that you are talking about perhaps, was the one about being in quotes wire tapped, meaning surveilled,  Trump said.  Guess what, it is turning out to be true. It is not turning out to be true in the least. Trump Tower was monitored for two years ending in 2013, but President Obama did not order it; the FBI did, and the probe led to gran jury indictments of 30 people involved in a Russian money laundering operation including one of the country s most notorious mob bosses.In addition, numerous Trump transition team members were caught up in  incidental collection  while intelligence agencies were looking into foreign criminals.Trump s desperate attempts to distract from the Russia investigation   especially since Michael Flynn offered to roll over in exchange for immunity   are at this point pathetic.Featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)",News,"April 3, 2017"
 Obama Officials Were Forced To Take BIZARRE Measure To Ensure Trump Didn’t Hide Russia Documents,"Investigations into Russian tampering and collusion during the election were gaining steam even before Trump took office, and the Obama administration was worried enough about it that they took an extraordinary measure to ensure that documents specific to the probe made it into the right hands.One former Obama official said that they had to create a list of  document serial numbers to give to senior members of the Senate Intelligence Committee,  according to NBC News. The numbers aren t classified, nor is the existence of such a series, however, to ensure that the Senate Intel Committee actually received the numbers, this official actually hand-delivered them.The numbers were intended to make it more difficult for the incoming administration to bury anything.We have an attorney general who committed perjury. We have a former national security adviser who lied about his contacts with Russia. We have a man in the White House who staffed his campaign with people with ties to Russia. The RNC paid an intel firm that works closely with Russia to dig up dirt on Hillary Clinton. The chairman of the House Intel Committee made it clear that he feels more of an obligation to Trump than he does to conducting a fair, impartial and thorough investigation. The list goes on, and Trump, given some of his recent tweets, is running scared.Besides that, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Senate Intel Committee have their hands on an unprecedented number of documents from the intelligence community relating to the probe. Ordinarily, documents of this nature would not make it into a Congressional investigation like this, but they have. That s probably put the fear of all the gods there are and aren t into Trump s black and shriveled heart.Since he had proven that the word  ethics  meant zilch to him following the Nov. 8 election, it s really no wonder that the Obama administration would worry about documents ending up languishing with the CIA at Langley, or possibly destroyed altogether, without anybody ever discovering their existence.The numbers went to people on Capitol Hill who are authorized to view their corresponding documents.Photo of Obama by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

 Maxine Waters: Let’s Talk About Impeaching Trump (VIDEO),"Rep. Maxine Waters says there s something she wants to talk about: impeachment.During a Sunday afternoon interview, CNN anchor Fredericka Whitfield asked Waters if Democrats were simply playing a game of tit for tat, going after Trump to get even for his role in the racist birther conspiracy surrounding former President Obama and the unprecedented obstructionism of Republicans.Waters said that even if you completely ignore  all of that,  what Trump has done since he was elected in November has been  outrageous  and  he has not provided legitimate leadership.  She said that she has no doubt that Trump was involved in the latest White House scandal with Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He has done so many things to show he doesn t understand government,  Waters said.  He s not willing to learn. He doesn t learn from his mistakes. Instead of learning, he gets up the next morning and tweets something all over again. Then, the Democratic congresswoman said that what she wants to talk about is this: if we can prove Trump colluded with Russia, then we can kick his orange-hued derriere out of the White House. We want to know whether or not there was collusion,  Waters said.  We want to know about the hacking into the DNC and the interference with our elections. And I really want to know because I know that if we can prove collusion, then he is impeachable. A lot of people don t want to talk about that, but I do,  she added.Watch Waters talk impeachment here, via CNN:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 2, 2017"
 Here’s The Third Turncoat Democrat Who Needs To Be Primaried Over SCOTUS In 2018 (DETAILS),"Another day, another  Democrat  who is backing the nominee for the Supreme Court seat that the Senate Republicans stole from President Obama. We have previously reported on how traitorous  Democrats  like Joe Manchin (DINO-WV) and Heidi Heitcamp (DINO-ND) have turned tail and voted with Republicans on many issues   most notably falling in line with Republicans in order to confirm right-wing potential Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. Now, we have a third to add to that list: Joe Donnelly of Indiana. Donnelly said of his decision to be a traitor to his party on this issue: After meeting with Judge Gorsuch, conducting a thorough review of his record, and closely following his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is well-respected among his peers. The only redeeming statement Donnelly has made is his expressing his opinion that the Senate should still have a 60-vote threshold when it comes to confirming Gorsuch or any other nominee for the Supreme Court. That is paramount, because it means that there is a true bipartisan Senate consensus for the Court s nominations and confirmations, which is a rule set by the founders to make sure that one party and its views do not dominate the judiciary.Of course, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cares not one whit about that; he and his fellow GOP cronies have insisted that Gorsuch will be on the Court  one way or another.  This means he is willing to breach the 60-vote rule to make sure Gorsuch makes it to the Supreme Court. What the Republicans did to President Obama s nominee Merrick Garland is a travesty and a disgrace, and the Democrats should do the same for Gorsuch. For those who won t   PRIMARY THEM. We have no time for DINOS in these troubled times. Oppose Trump at every turn, or the good folks at We Will Replace You will have you heads, as they should.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 2, 2017"
 Trump Just Got BURNED In An Epic Poem Written By A 14-Year-Old Boy,"Donald Trump will explode when he reads this.Trump is a national embarrassment who never should have been allowed to run for the presidency to begin with. His antics during the campaign and after have divided the country and turned us into an laughingstock around the world.Throughout his campaign, Trump attacked Latinos, women, African-Americans, Muslims, and Jews. He constantly bullied and threatened people. And he even urged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton and the DNC.Since taking office, Trump has been disastrous for our country. His scandals are racking up as much as his frequent golf trips and it s clear that Trump is incapable of governing responsibly and ethically. Trump has also embarrassed himself repeatedly on Twitter and often opens his mouth when he should keep it shut.And that s why 14-year-old Owen Pallenberg wrote a poem all about Trump s campaign and his various antics at the time and in the present day. The Race  begins with the campaign, takes us to the depressing election, and concludes with the aftermath and what should be done to rid our country of Trump.Here s the full poem via Huffington Post.A man and a woman were running a race.The man dressed in red with a very orange face,And the woman dressed in blue with a pantsuit and a briefcase.The race was much longer than a dash, mile or marathon,And to many Americans it felt like it went on and on.This was a race of old and new ideas and one thought,And so the race started with the sound of a gunshot.The woman dressed in blue was off to a great start,She was gaining support and was eager to do her part.However the man in the red was racist and sexist I m sure you would agree,He even said he wanted to grab a woman by her As the competitors turned the corner you got a glimpse of the fans,And you could hear in the distance a chant about a man with small hands.He claimed his hands and feet were quite big,All while having a bright orange spray tan and a big yellow wig.About halfway through the race the man was falling behind,And the supporters of the woman were happy to have saved mankind.As the competitors were nearing the finish line,The people in blue were already celebrating and drinking their wine.The woman approached the finish with a big, wide grin,But then something happened that seemed to be the work of Vladimir Putin.The woman fell down and lost her lead,The win began to feel a lot less guaranteed.The man hurdled over her body and crossed the finish,And we all knew our Nation s reputation would certainly diminish.The man had somehow done it, he actually won,The supporters in blue sat in shock and ceased all of their fun.The man was apparently going to Make America Great Again with his campaign,And the woman was depressed and had to put away her celebratory champagne .The results of this race tore apart our land,As millions of Muslims were immediately banned.This man can do absolutely no good,Except run his mouth and claim he was just misunderstood.The man has stated  we need global warming  for all to hear,Which has made me quite certain that the end is near.He has called women ugly and fat,Which has left me wondering how he could have won the race and done all that.After insulting and making fun of men and women nationwide,I ve become mortified, horrified, and have lost my American pride.Everytime he talks or makes a speech,All I can say is impeach, impeach, impeach.Now we just have to wait until Donald Trump becomes the first president to attack a 14-year-old kid.That would be a new low.Featured Image: Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"April 2, 2017"
 WATCH: Trump’s EPA Stooge Gets His A** Handed To Him By Fox Host On Climate Change,"Donald Trump is fuming after Fox New Sunday host Chris Wallace crushed his Environmental Protection Agency minion on the topic of climate change.As we all know, Trump is a climate change denier who thinks the whole thing is a scam created by the Chinese.So, of course, Trump chose a fellow climate change denier as his EPA Secretary.Scott Pruitt is an Oklahoma Republican who denies science, and during an interview on Fox, he found himself having to defend his anti-science views. Apparently, he hoped the interview would be a softball affair. But Chris Wallace repeatedly challenged him.Wallace began by slamming Pruitt s flawed logic that getting rid of President Obama s clean power plan will somehow improve air quality. You think that rewriting and, in fact, doing away with the clean power plan is going to improve air quality, which you say is a major goal?  Wallace asked.Pruitt responded by claiming that President Obama was a tyrant who ruled through executive orders instead of letting Congress make the law.It should be pointed out that Donald Trump has signed 23 executive orders and he hasn t even served 100 days yet. He is on pace to sign 118 executive orders in his first year alone. President Obama only signed 276 over the course of eight years and signed less executive orders than Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan.Trump could very well end up signing more executive orders than any of them. So, Pruitt can t seriously claim that Trump is following the  rule of law.  If anyone is ruling by  executive fiat,  it s Trump.Wallace then pointed out that Trump s deregulation of environmental protections has ceded the moral high ground to China in the fight against pollution and climate change.Pruitt didn t really give a damn. He said America has nothing to apologize for. We have nothing to be apologetic about with respect to the leadership we ve show as a country,  he claimed.Oh, but we do. Fighting climate change to save out planet will take international cooperation on a unprecedented scale. By withdrawing American leadership, Trump is sentencing the globe to disastrous climate change as if he thinks the United States is not part of the world and is somehow immune to what happens around us.Wallace proceeded to take on Pruitt s belief that humans are not responsible for climate change. Mr. Pruitt, there are all kinds of studies that contradict you,  Wallace noted.  The UN panel on climate change says it s 95 percent likely that at least half of the temperature increase since the mid-20th century is due to human activities. Mr. Pruitt, are we supposed to believe that s all a coincidence? In response, Pruitt contradicted his own claim that he and Trump are working to improve air quality by insisting that the EPA should not be able to regulate greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide.Wallace called Pruitt out an dropped the hammer on him. Sir, you re sugar coating what you have said. You said that you would not agree that carbon CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming. And the question I have is, what if you re wrong? What if, in fact, the Earth is warming, what if it is causing dramatic climate change and that we as humans through carbon emissions are contributing to it? Don t you think the fact that we have these coal power plants belching carbon emissions into the air, you don t think that plays a role? Pruitt answered by claiming that America burns coal cleanly, which is not true at all. There is no such thing as  clean coal,  and making such a claim is asinine.Here s the video via YouTube.According to Popular Mechanics,Coal will never be clean. It is possible to make coal emissions cleaner. In fact, we ve come a long way since the  70s in finding ways to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen-oxide emissions, and more progress can be made. But the nut of the clean-coal sales pitch is that we can also bottle up the CO2 produced when coal is burned, most likely by burying it deep in the earth. That may be possible in theory, but it s devilishly difficult in practice.President Obama s clean power plan would have reduced carbon emissions more than they ever have been before. It was a crucial step toward fighting climate change and reducing America s role in causing it.But Donald Trump and his minions have reversed that progress and they are making things even worse. They are gutting the Environmental Protection Agency and have pulled America out the fight against climate change. So instead of moving forward, Trump is taking America backwards and that decision will have devastating results that Trump will personally experience once his Mar-a-Lago resort is under water because of sea level rise.Maybe when his precious golf club and resort is under water he ll admit that climate change is real. But by then, it will be too late.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 2, 2017"
 Confused Old Man Shows Up At The Golf Course Instead Of His Job For 14th Time In 10 Weeks,"A tired 70-year-old man keeps forgetting to show up at his new job and instead, he has repeatedly gone golfing. The irony is that this same man routinely mocked the man who previously held his job for golfing. This man s job title: Commander-in-Chief. We suspect that former reality show star Donald Trump didn t realize that being the alleged leader of the free world would be a difficult job. Trump is up to his eyeballs in scandals and instead of addressing them, he s either tweeting or on the golf course, or both.Again, the Twitter-addicted amateur president is playing golf at a Trump-owned golf course, raising more concerns over his mounting conflicts of interest.The White House press pool reports that Trump is meeting with budget director Mick Mulvaney and Senator Rand Paul. Last time Trump went golfing, he claimed to be in meetings, however, that doesn t appear to be true.Trump returned to the same golf club in Virginia.Last year, during a campaign rally, Trump referred to his golf courses when criticizing former President Barack Obama.The Independent reports:The President has visited his own-branded properties approximately once every three days during the course of his presidency so far, according to The Washington Post. You know what   and I love golf   but if I were in the White House, I don t think I d ever see Turnberry again,  Trump declared.  I don t think I d ever see Doral again, I own Doral in Miami, I don t think I d ever see many of the places that I have. I don t ever think that I d see anything, I just wanna stay in the White House and work my ass off, make great deals, right? Who s gonna leave? I mean, who s gonna leave?  he said.At a 2016 rally in Virginia, Trump said,  I m going to be working for you, I m not going to have time to go play golf.

 Trump Embarrasses Himself With Yet Another Desperate Tweet About Russia (TWEETS),"On Sunday morning. Donald Trump once again revealed how desperate he is with regard to that teensy tiny little Russia thing with yet another unhinged tweet complaining about people leaking information about his team s collusion with Vladimir Putin.Recently, Michael Flynn s offer to testify in exchange for immunity   a condition he said last year was an indicator that one is guilty of something   sent The Donald into what can only be described as a complete panic. Trump, who agrees that immunity means  guilty,  also says that Flynn should get himself some immunity.It s clear that something is rotten in Trumpvillle, and our so-called President knows exactly what it is   all those damn people revealing his administration s secrets involving Vladimir Putin, his allies, lots of money, some hackers and fake news creators, and probably a couple of Russia pee pee hookers.Once again, Trump complained about all the leaks that don t happen on a Moscow hotel bed Barack Obama once slept in.  The real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING!  Trump said.  Find the leakers. The real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING! Find the leakers.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2017The real story is actually the fact that 17 intelligence agencies agree that Vladimir Putin directly interfered in our election through both state-funded hacking and propaganda efforts involving multitudes of actual paid trolls. The real story is that there is strong evidence that Trump campaign officials worked with a hostile foreign dictator to attack our nation  and that Mr. 45 may be involved.Naturally, Twitter had a lot to say about Trump s latest moronic outburst:@realDonaldTrump GOD YOU ARE SO DUMB  BenDavid Grabinski (@bdgrabinski) April 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump  are you telling us to look for your kompromat piss tape?

 WATCH: Chuck Todd Puts The Screws To Mitch McConnell For Not Giving Merrick Garland A Chance,"Mitch McConnell is still making ridiculous excuses to justify what Senate Republicans did to Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.When Antonin Scalia passed away in February 2016, his body was not even cold before Republicans declared that they would refuse to hold hearings to confirm any replacement chosen by President Obama.And so, when President Obama selected a centrist judge named Merrick Garland to be the next Supreme Court Justice, Republicans immediately refused to do their job as outlined by the Constitution.Republicans tried to excuse their behavior by claiming that Democrats would have done the same thing even though Democrats have never once refused to grant a nominee a confirmation hearing. Furthermore, Republicans claimed that no Supreme Court nominee has ever been approved by the Senate in an election year.McConnell made the same claim on Sunday after Chuck Todd grilled him in response to Republican insistence that Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch be confirmed immediately. The tradition had been not to confirm vacancies in the middle of a presidential [election] year,  McConnell said.  You d have to go back 80 years to find the last time it happened. Everyone knew, including President Obama s former White House counsel, that if the shoe had been on the other foot, [Democrats] wouldn t have filled a Republican president s vacancy in the middle of a presidential election. Again, Democrats have never refused to hold a confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court nominee.Also, Mitch McConnell is ignorant of Senate history.As it turns out, there have been several election year confirmations of Supreme Court nominees and we don t have to go back 80 years to find one.In fact, the last one occurred only 29 years ago when the Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988 during Ronald Reagan s last year in office.It also happened in 1956 when Dwight Eisenhower nominated William Brennan. The Senate confirmed him despite it being an election year.In 1940, also an election year, Franklin Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the Supreme Court and the Senate confirmed him.So contrary to what Mitch McConnell says, there is plenty of precedent in our history proving that the Senate has no such  tradition  of not confirming Supreme Court nominees during an election year.Todd challenged McConnell for not simply holding a confirmation hearing and giving Garland an up or down vote. Why not put him up for a vote?  Todd asked.  Any senator can have a rationale to not vote for a confirmation. Why not put Merrick Garland on the floor and if the rationale is,  You know what? Too close to an election,  then vote no? Look, we litigated that last year,  a flustered McConnell replied.  The American people decided that they wanted Donald Trump to make the nomination, not Hillary Clinton. Actually, the American people voted for Hillary Clinton. She won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.McConnell then claimed that there s  no rational reason  to not vote to confirm Gorsuch. But that s not true either. You see, by refusing to grant Garland a confirmation hearing, Republicans set a precedent and gave Democrats all the reasons they need to block Gorsuch at all costs.Plus, Gorsuch has a terrible record and he was nominated by Trump, which is all the more reason for Democrats to block him.If Senate Republicans had not acted like petulant children in response to Merrick Garland, perhaps Democrats would have been more open. But the way Republicans treated Garland was un-American and totally outrageous. They disgraced the Senate with their conduct and Democrats now have precedent to respond in kind.But McConnell balked when Todd challenged him to take up a resolution that says Supreme Court vacancies won t be filled during an election year. In short, McConnell knows that if a Republican had been president in 2016, Senate Republicans would have rushed any Supreme Court nomination through. Because in the end, Republicans are hypocrites.Here s the video via YouTube.There is no excuse for Democrats to not block Neil Gorsuch from becoming a Supreme Curt Justice. In fact, if Republicans somehow get him confirmed, Democrats should impeach him as soon as they take back control of the Senate. This Supreme Court seat rightfully belongs to Merrick Garland. He deserves a fair confirmation hearing before Republicans are ever able to nominate someone to the Supreme Court again. Until then, Republican nominees should be the same and worse than the way Republicans treated Merrick Garland.And Republicans only have themselves to blame.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 2, 2017"
 Federal Judge Rules That Trump DID Incite Violence During 2016 Campaign (DETAILS),"Hearing about violence at Trump s rallies was a regular occurrence during his 2016 campaign and that violence was often brought on by Trump himself.At a rally back in March of 2016, Trump yelled,  Get  em out of here,  referencing the peaceful protesters in the crowd, which then prompted his supporters to physically attack them. The protesters who were attacked brought suit against Trump and it looks like he s finally going to have to pay for it   in more ways than one.Trump s lawyers have been using the free speech defense, but a Federal Judge isn t buying it. Citing case law from 1960 s student protests and race riots, Judge David Hale of Kentucky, rejected motions to dismiss the case and said that Trump did indeed cite violence at his rally. It is plausible that Trump s direction to  get  em out of here  advocated the use of force. Unlike the statements at issue in the cases cited by the Trump Defendants,  get  em out of here  is stated in the imperative; it was an order, an instruction, a command. Trump craves the sound of people cheering him on, and no doubt probably enjoyed seeing his supporters attack people who were brave enough to show up and stand against him, so it wasn t surprising when Trump denied wrongdoing of any sort and blamed it all on the  bad dudes  who were protesting. In fact, that phrase became a regular mantra for Trump. We have some protesters who are bad dudes,  he said. They have done bad things, and they are really dangerous and get in there and start hitting people, and we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people.   It s usually the police, the municipal government because I don t have guards all over these stadiums. I mean, we fill up stadiums. The suit against Trump also names the three individuals responsible for the attacks, one of whom, Matthew Heimbach, is a leader of the white supremacist group Traditional Youth Network from Paoli, Indiana, which will probably make it that much worse for Trump. Watching him try to squirm his way out of this one should be really fun!Featured image via Getty/Sarah Rice",News,"April 2, 2017"
 John McCain Was Asked If Trump Was Like Reagan; His Answer Was PERFECT (VIDEO),"For Republicans, being compared to Ronald Reagan is something akin to being compared to Jesus. Both figures are revered among Republicans for being nothing like they actually were. Of course, that doesn t stop many from comparing Donald Trump to Reagan, when pretty much the only things they had in common were being wealthy and having few skills other than being showmen. Okay, perhaps they do have quite a bit in common, but when John McCain was asked by David Axelrod if Trump was like Reagan, his answer was a firmly decisive  no. McCain said he found  appalling  Trump s assertion in an interview earlier this year that the US lacked the moral standing to question Russian President Vladimir Putin s human rights abuses.  We ve got a lot of killers. What do you think, our country s so innocent?  Trump said at the time. To state that there s some moral equivalency between an imperfect nation   that s the United States of America   and Vladimir Putin is appalling,  McCain responded. And I think it s pretty clear that there s a difference between, well, aren t we killers and the guy that stood there and said,  Mr. Gorbachev, take down this wall,'  he said.McCain even went so far as to say that in Russia s interfering in our election, they ve done something far worse than attack us with conventional weapons. It s one thing to destroy a building with a bomb or inflict damage, but if you destroy the fundamentals of a free and open society, which is what democracy is all about, you inflict incredibly heavier damage,  he said.Here s the video:Reagan, of course, became president during the Cold War, when Russia was the Soviet Union. It was communist instead of a capitalist oligarchy. Getting into bed with Russians then wouldn t have won him the white Middle America poorly educated vote. Times, though, have changed. Russia is no longer filled with commies and well, we had eight years of a black guy and the very real prospect that the next president would have been a woman. To Trump voters, that s much scarier than anything a former KGB agent who s known to kill his political enemies can do.The fact that McCain is saying this is significant, though. The investigation may be stalled in the House but it s now in the Senate and there is no Devin Nunes. Even Republicans seem in shock by the actions of the Russians. McCain isn t the only one. As for Reagan, well, he had a little thing called Iran-Contra which helped him win his election. So, I guess he and Trump have even more than being rich hacks in common. They were both propelled into office by a hostile foreign country.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"April 2, 2017"

 DNC Chair Not Holding Back On GOP: ‘They Don’t Give A Sh*t About People’ (VIDEO),"Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez didn t mince words when he called out the GOP for their appalling health care plan. Their plan would have resulted in tens of millions of Americans being without insurance coverage by the end of the next decade. Perez made his point loud and clear when he explained that the reason Republicans are okay with this plan is because they just  don t give a sh*t about people. Perez made the comments at an event for the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, which was broadcast live on Facebook. While speaking to the crowd, he discussed Republicans  failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act last month.The DNC chair said that Trump  wants his name on everything,  but for some reason, he didn t want his name associated with the GOP s  Make America Sick Again  plan in any way, shape, or form. Well I ll tell you my idea, because you know what embodies their program?  I don t care,  Perez said of the GOP s health care plan, prompting a round of applause from the crowd. Because they don t give a s  about people. Perez served as former President Barack Obama s Labor secretary and was elected as chairman of the DNC in February. His first act in this new role was to nominate Rep. Keith Ellison, who had run against him for the position, as his deputy.You can watch Perez slam the GOP and their wealth care plan in the video below, via the New Jersey Working Families Alliance: Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images",News,"April 1, 2017"

 REPORT: Trump Is Costing America BILLIONS In Tourism Revenues Because People Are Afraid To Travel Here,"Donald Trump won t tell you this on his Twitter feed.The last time the tourism industry in this country saw such a drop was in the decade after 9/11.And now, Trump is the reason why people don t want to come to America.Under President Obama, the tourism industry enjoyed a resurgence as the number of international visitors rose to 78 million in 2015, a 27 million increase from 2006.But that s imploding now as Trump s policies continue to scare the hell out of people around the globe.Trump s travel ban, his proposed border wall, his attacks on our allies, and his anti-immigrant nationalist policies have struck fear into international travelers who wish to come to the United States to tour the land of the free.According to Alternet,Frommer s, a prominent travel guide, notes that  the prestigious Travel Weekly magazine (as close to an  official  travel publication as they come) has set the decline in foreign tourism at 6.8 percent  for this year. ForwardKeys, which crunches travel numbers, points to a 6.5 percent downturn in international travel to the U.S. in the week after Trump attempted to issue the Muslim travel ban in January. During the same period, the company found reservations for U.S.-bound flights from Western Europe fell 14 percent and plunged 38 percent from across the Middle East. And a survey released this month by the Global Business Travel Association concluded  45 percent of European business travel professionals say they are less likely to schedule meetings or events in the U.S.,  according to the Los Angeles Times.Even white foreigners from Canada and Europe are choosing to stay away from the United States because of Donald Trump.And the impact will do a lot of damage to our economy, including a loss of jobs and a decrease in our gross domestic product.The loss of all those visitors could mean future problems for a sector on which more than 15 million people rely for employment. Oxford Economics suggests the toll may ultimately ripple beyond the travel industry, even reducing the U.S. gross domestic product by a few percentage points, per Market Watch.This will particularly affect cities and states on the coasts where popular destinations such as Los Angeles, Miami, and New York City are located. As stated above, the ripple effects could reach beyond the travel industry as the lack of tourism dollars will hurt the hotel industry, restaurants, airlines, retail stores, and any other industry that profits from tourism.So this is a big deal that will hurt our country as long as Trump remains in office.America s thriving $250 billion tourism industry is about to take a serious $7.4 billion hit because of Trump s policies. It s a huge setback on our economy and it s only going to get worse as Trump continues to attack Mexico and China.So just remember that while Trump continues to tout plans by automakers and other companies that were made way before he took office, the tourism bubble is about pop on his watch and his policies are directly to blame.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"April 1, 2017"
 Trump Makes An Absolute FOOL Of Himself On April Fool’s Day; Americans Outraged,"His accusation that President Obama wiretapped him has been thoroughly debunked but Donald Trump attacked NBC anchor Chuck Todd for not covering the fake story.Last month, Trump posted a series of tweets openly accusing President Obama of wiretapping him.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Is it legal for a sitting President to be  wire tapping  a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump s accusation set off a firestorm around the country because Trump literally accused a former president of a felony.As it turns out, Trump s accusation was totally wrong. FBI Director James Comey dropped a bombshell on Trump s claim by stating under oath that there was no such wiretap. Furthermore, when given a deadline to provide evidence to Congress supporting Trump s claim, the Justice Department didn t deliver because there is no such evidence.Trump s claim was merely meant to distract Congress and the media from focusing on the growing Russia scandal.NBC anchor Chuck Todd was not distracted by Trump, and that s why Trump attacked Todd on Saturday and repeated his accusation against President Obama in yet another embarrassing rant on Twitter.When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017It is the same Fake News Media that said there is  no path to victory for Trump  that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017Again, Trump is falsely accusing President Obama of wiretapping him even though the claim has been debunked by high level authorities. Also, Comey told Congress that the FBI is investigating Trump for colluding with Russia during the 2016 Election.And the evidence against Trump continues to pile up. Even disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is asking for an immunity deal. His testimony could blow the lid off the Russia scandal and put Trump behind bars for high treason.Thus far, Todd has not responded to Trump s attack, but Twitter did it for him.@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews I love how the president calls people names.

 George Takei Just Shook Washington To Its Core; The Reason Will Make Team Trump FURIOUS (DETAILS),"By now, we all know that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes has turned tail and gone off on what his fellow GOPer in the Senate, Lindsey Graham (R-SC) calls an  Inspector Clouseau investigation.  In other words, Nunes is a bumbling idiot and a stooge for the Trump White House when it comes to investigating ties between officials from Donald Trump s presidential campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.Well, it now seems that Nunes (R-CA) might have a bit of a problem come 2018. Star Trek star and wildly popular  LGBTQ rights activist George Takei is running for Congress   against Nunes. The endeavor was largely secret, until Takei and his husband were found out as they started scoping out property to buy in Nunes s red district. Takei says of the move: Well, I guess the jig is up.  With what is going on now in the country, I couldn t stand by any longer merely as a citizen. I knew I had to take a bigger stand. So that s why I m running for Congress. My hope is to challenge Davin Nunes for his seat in 2018. I think Nunes is vulnerable. And I plan to prove that. People are tired of his ass-kissing of Trump. Can I say that? I think I can. These days you can say pretty much anything and not get in trouble. I want to be a champion for all people, but especially those whose voices are not heard often in the halls of Congress. We need to build a majority again in Congress, too, to be a check against the Trump Administration s excesses, assuming he s even around by then to keep making horrific mistakes.

 Elijah Cummings Just Asked 5 Questions The White House Is Scared To Death Of Answering,"Rep. Elijah E. Cummings is demanding answers after presidential staff members reportedly passed confidential information to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and helped him sneak onto White House grounds.Cummings, who is the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter to White House Counsel Donald McGahn and National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster on Friday in which he asked some questions the White House really doesn t want to answer.The letter made it clear that Cummings wants to know just exactly who knew what when. Over the past two days, press accounts have reported that staff who work directly for you contacted Rep. Devin Nunes, the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, secured his entry into the White House complex on March 21, 2017, and provided him with access to classified information, which he then conveyed to the President the following day.  I am writing to request information about whether you both were aware of these actions I do not know if these press accounts are accurate, but if they are, they raise serious questions in light of previous denials by the White House and the fact that these White House officials report to you,  Cummings wrote. The Democratic congressman cited multiple conflicting reports that have come from the administration. After naming the staffers and the allegations against each of them, Cummings asked five questions that have the White House scared to death:(1)  Were either of you personally aware of the activities of your own staff in contacting Chairman Nunes, facilitating his entry onto the White House grounds, or providing him with access to classified information?(2)  If so, when did you become aware?  Did you inform Mr. Spicer of their activities, and if so, when did you do so?(3)  If you were not aware, then how did this breach of the chain of command occur?(4)  If these activities occurred without your knowledge, will any disciplinary measures be taken against these staff for this apparent breach?(5)  Was anyone else at the White House involved in these activities, and if so, who?Cummings  questions should have the Trump administration shaking in their boots. No doubt we will hear far more lies from the White House before we ever get close to the truth. Cummings gave McGahn and McMaster until April 7 to respond with their next version of the truth.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 1, 2017"
 Trump Has Brain Fart In Middle Of Executive Order Signing Leaving Pence To Frantically Cover (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is unwell.The beleaguered president seemed vaguely irritated and distracted in what was meant to be a routine executive order signing. After remarks by Mike Pence, Trump said just a few words before hastily leaving the room. The one thing he forgot to do was the whole reason he was there in the first place: sign the executive order.Realizing Trump s mistake, Pence scrambles to stop Trump and get him to sign the document. Instead, Trump orders him to get the folder from his desk and bring it to him to sign outside of the room. Pence, realizing he s about to go viral as a bit player in Trump s latest on-camera screw up, awkwardly saunters over to the desk, grabs the folder and rushes out of the room.Trump walked out of an executive order signing ceremony without having signed the executive orders pic.twitter.com/v0SjanotTe  POLITICO (@politico) March 31, 2017Trump appeared reluctant to come back into the room and it s pretty obvious why. As he mistakenly left, a reporter began asking him questions about his baffling remarks about Michael Flynn on Twitter this morning.Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2017It s understandable that he didn t want to explain the tweet, it could lead to Trump s eventual downfall. As the New York Times points out, should the DOJ give Michael Flynn immunity, it would mean they likely have bigger fish to fry.Immunity should be granted as soon as Congress and prosecutors are persuaded that Mr. Flynn has information that will lead to a criminal case against one or more people at least as important to the alleged wrongdoing as Mr. Flynn may be. The overriding objective must be learning who if anyone in the United States collaborated with the Russians as well as who knew about it, what they knew and when they knew it.Who might that big fish be?

 Looks Like Mike Pence Is Gonna Go Down With The #TrumpRussia Ship (VIDEO),"If there is anyone who is a thorn in the side of the Donald Trump administration, it s MSNBC host Rachel Maddow. She is relentless in her thorough and well thought out journalism, exposing Trump for the fraud that he is.In yet another report, while many think if Trump is impeached or forced to resign Mike Pence will take over the role of president, Maddow is letting America and the world know he may go down with the ship.Maddow reports: Mike Pence had been the head of the Trump transition. As such, he would have been intimately involved with the selection and vetting process for a job as important as national security adviser. Nevertheless, Vice President Mike Pence has professed absolute ignorance of any of the scandals of any of the foreign payments, contacts and all the rest of it surrounding Mike Flynn. Pence was the leader of the transition. As leader of the transition, he was notified in writing by members of Congress about Flynn s apparent financial ties to the government of Turkey. The transition was also apparently notified twice by Flynn s own lawyers about his financial relationship with the government of Turkey, but nevertheless, Vice President Mike Pence says he has no idea about any of that. Further: Vice President Mike Pence claims he had absolutely no idea about that despite him being notified about on the record multiple times and it being a matter of considerable public discussion. Mike Pence s role in the Mike Flynn scandal is flashing like a red beacon for anyone who sees him as the normal Republican in this setting. Maddow is absolutely correct. There is no way, with all this information coming out, that Pence was left completely in the dark with no knowledge of what has been going on. If Trump is going down, Pence will undoubtedly go down with him   as he should.Watch Maddow here:Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images   HT Politicus",News,"March 31, 2017"
 Study Shows Conservative Voters Are Literally Twice As Shallow As Liberal Voters (DETAILS),"A study was just released that said that conservative politicians are better looking than their liberal counterparts, and the reason for it shows that liberals are better at picking leaders.The study, published in the Journal of Public Economics, and performed by researchers at the University of Helsinki, examined politicians and academics from Europe and the United States. The fact that left-leaning scholars are perceived as better-looking is no cause for alarm,  Prof (Jan-Erik) L nnqvist said.  What is worrying, however, is the high degree of importance attached to looks in political elections. He added:  The results of my study are in concordance with other studies that show that the effect of attractive looks is twice as large for politicians on the right compared to their counterparts on the left. While it did not find that conservative academics were better looking, conservative politicians won the overall beauty contest and believe it or not, that s likely how we got Donald Trump.Hear me out. No, while Trump is expert at leering at and sexually harassing beauty contestants, there s no sash in his future. So, what does Trump s election have to do with conservatives being more attractive people? Conservative voters, it seems, are shallow people. They are less capable of getting past the superficial and understanding nuanced campaign issues. Now are you getting the connection to Trump?Or, as Dr. L nnqvist suggested: One possible reason for the greater influence of looks on right-wing constituents could be that they are less informed. Previous research has also shown that conservative voters have a more concrete, perhaps less sophisticated way of thinking. That is probably why the nation is in much better hands with Democratic presidents. It also might show why Democrats have a harder time winning. Our views are much more complex, as is our taste in candidates. Republicans campaign on bumper sticker slogans and Democrats campaign on issues. It s much easier to rally people around bumper sticker slogans than around complicated ideas.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,"March 31, 2017"

 The Senate Intelligence Committee Has Bad News For Flynn After He Requested Immunity,"Disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has asked for immunity in exchange for testifying in the FBI s continuing investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia and he has an answer from the Senate Intelligence Committee. Two Congressional sources told NBC News that the committee declined Flynn s lawyer s request.According to a senior congressional official with direct knowledge of the case, Flynn s lawyer was told it was  wildly preliminary  and that immunity was  not on the table  at the moment. Another source weighed in to say that the committee communicated that it is  not receptive  to Flynn s request  at this time. The senior congressional official added that Flynn s lawyer had conveyed the offer of testimony in exchange for immunity from prosecution to the Justice Department.Alleged president Donald Trump tweeted this morning:Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2017The thought is that either the authorities have nothing on Flynn or they have bigger fish to fry and there s only one person above the former National Security Adviser in this scenario: Donald J. Trump. Or, the evidence already collected on Flynn is damning and they don t need to make a deal   the latter of which is possible.Flynn was fired after lying about speaking with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about Obama-era sanctions. From there, things got worse for Flynn. He also met with Kislyak for about 20 minutes at Trump Tower in December. Just one week later, Flynn registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for $530,000 worth of lobbying work he did before the 2016 election that  could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey. In a statement Thursday, Flynn s lawyer Robert Kelner said no  reasonable person  would get questioned in  such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurance against unfair prosecution. However, in 2016, Flynn was seen at a Trump rally leading  Lock her up!  chants then saying that if he did  one tenth  what Hillary Clinton did, he would be in jail. In addition, on Meet the Press last year, Flynn said,  When you are given immunity, that means that you ve probably committed a crime. Ouchies!

 Republican’s Excuse For Cutting Food Stamps: The Bible Says Unemployed ‘Shall Not Eat’,"Republican lawmakers love using the Bible to dictate their policies. They especially love using it to justify pushing spending cuts to social programs   even if it means intentionally misreading their favorite passages.In Texas, Rep. Jodey Arrington decided his support for cutting parts of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program needed a bit of New Testament spin. How does one defend taking the food out of mouths of hungry people using the Bible? By cherrypicking this quote: If a man will not work, he shall not eat. During a debate on whether or not Republicans will further gut SNAP benefits, Arrington cited the biblical verse in response to a Jewish anti-hunger group pleading with Congress not to do something so foolish as to further dismantle food stamps. He probably thought he was being pretty clever.Arrington isn t the first to use the line. It s extremely popular with conservatives. So popular, in fact, that the Daily Kos once devoted an entire article to debunking the misinterpretation of the quote.What s important to understand is working was secondary in this context, this is not so much a moral decree about work, the main message is a warning not to take advantage of the Christian obligation to feed the hungry, especially if you are screwing up the church and community tasked with doing that by behaving like a twelve year-old socialite.In other words, the real meaning is to judge a man by his heart, not by his employment status. And as the Washington Post points out, in today s economy, being  unemployed  doesn t mean lazy, unmotivated, or being a leech. As the economy continues to separate between the  haves  and the  have-nots,  finding employment can be hard.The verse in question applies specifically to people who can work or otherwise contribute to society but choose not to, said theologians from several denominations who spoke to The Post. There is a perception, among some voters and lawmakers, that many adult SNAP recipients are exactly this sort of  freeloader. But policy experts say that is not the case. Many unemployed adults on SNAP simply cannot work, they say. Those include the mentally ill, the borderline disabled and veterans.Here s economist Justin Wolfers putting the sad reality of America s employment into a stunning graph:It takes a certain kind of mind to look at these trends and conclude that tax cuts for the top 1% are an urgent national priority. pic.twitter.com/6s9Jwr0a8w  Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) March 31, 2017Arrington has both biblical and economic reasons to doubt his own reasoning. Instead, his real ideology   the Church of Conservative Magical Thinking   led him to ignore it all in favor of more cuts to the poor to benefit the very richest in the country.And as if voters needed yet another reminder of why elections matter: Arrington has only been on the job two months. He was voted into office this year. He barely moved into his office and already he s going after the most disadvantaged people in his district. Hats off to his efficiency, but then, institutionalized cruelty often is.Featured image via the Washington Post",News,"March 31, 2017"
" Ex-Intel Official Weighs In On Flynn Immunity With Some Really, REALLY Bad News For Trump (VIDEO)","Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn gave Donald Trump something to worry about last night, when he announced that he would testify on the Trump campaign s possible ties to Russia in exchange for immunity. As more experts weigh in on this, it s not looking good for Trump at all. According to a former top intelligence official, the only way Flynn will get the immunity he s seeking is if he gives up Trump.Jeremy Bash, former counsel to the House Intelligence Committee and the ex-chief of staff for both the CIA and Department of Defense, weighed in on Flynn in an interview for MSNBC: For the Justice Department to agree to give somebody like him immunity, it means they want him to turn and testify against someone higher up in the food chain. Who is higher up in the food chain, higher than the national security adviser? There s really only one person, and so this shows that the jeopardy of criminal liability actually extends all the way to the top. As of right now, Flynn s offer to testify for immunity has not been accepted by investigators, which makes Bash wonder, Immunity from what? What is he in jeopardy of being prosecuted for?  Bash advised that Flynn could be prosecuted under the Espionage Act for getting classified briefings for the Trump campaign. Bash said: That is a major felony, and that is essentially treason. It would not surprise me at all if what the prosecutors said to Flynn s lawyers is,  We haven t reached any conclusions on the Russian matter, but we have your guy dead to rights for not registering under the laws requiring registration as a foreign agent and second of conspiring to engage in kidnapping   you better come in and make a deal.' Bash made sure to reiterate that investigators will not accept Flynn s offer unless he gave up information about crimes Trump had committed. Bash said: You can only give somebody immunity, full immunity, if it s worth it. They have to believe it s worth it in this case.

 Trump Gets Smacked Down After His Immensely Stupid Flynn Immunity Tweet (TWEETS),"Last year, in an effort to demonize Hillary Clinton staffers, Trump ally Michael Flynn famously said that immunity means  you ve probably committed a crime    a quote that is now coming back to bite him in his ass now that he is begging for immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying against Donald Trump.What Flynn did or the extent of his crimes is still a mystery as is what Flynn knows   but you don t ask for immunity unless you re ready to give up something big (like the President of the United States).

 Trump Scandal EXPLODES As Flynn’s Own Words On Immunity Come Back To Bite Him In The Ass (VIDEO),"Much like the incompetent POTUS they are working under, many members of the Trump administration have said things in the past that have come back to haunt them. And now, a new discovery about General Michael Flynn, who resigned from his position as National Security Adviser, is likely going to result in the crumbling of the Trump administration.Last night, it was reported that Flynn was asking for immunity in exchange for testimony on Russia   and a few comments he made last September came to light, which certainly will not be helping his case (or Trump s).Apparently, last year on Meet The Press, Flynn made some remarks about Clinton campaign chair John Podesta regarding immunity, which now make him seem incredibly guilty. Flynn said: Yeah, so a couple things, the very last thing that John Podesta just said is no individual too big to jail, that should include people like Hillary Clinton. I mean, five people around her have had, have been given immunity, to include her former Chief of Staff. When you are given immunity, that means that you ve probably committed a crime. So you know, I don t know how he can sit there and say something like that with all the, the things that have been going around, just swirling around Hillary Clinton with her email. Yes, he said,  When you are given immunity, that means that you ve probably committed a crime. Flynn has practically closed the case on himself with that statement. You can watch Flynn s past self basically ruin his future below:Flynn s counsel, Robert Kelner, has released a statement saying that Flynn  has a story to tell  and tried to make a case for why Flynn would seek immunity.

 Intel Committee Member: ‘Innocent People Don’t Ask For Immunity’ (VIDEO),"Michael Flynn drove another nail into the coffin of Donald Trump s presidency on Thursday when he agreed to testify about Russia in exchange for immunity. This prompted one member of the House Intelligence Committee to state the obvious:  Innocent people don t ask for immunity. Speaking to MSNBC s Chris Hayes, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said what we have all been thinking since the announcement was made that Flynn was willing to testify in exchange for immunity. If you didn t do anything wrong, then you don t need immunity. The only reason to seek immunity is to protect yourself from prosecution from the illegal crap you ve done. Innocent people don t ask for immunity, but that s not something that I m familiar with in our investigation. If he has something to say and he s not worried about what he did, he should just come forward and testify in a public setting,  Swalwell added.Hayes argued that there might be some scenarios where an innocent person would ask for immunity. The MSNBC host said that asking for immunity doesn t automatically mean you are guilty of something. What if they are worried about perjury? Or concerned that maybe their words could somehow be used against them in some other way? Hey, it s possible, right?Swalwell wasn t having it. He said that prosecutors don t run around seeking perjury charges because somebody had a lapse of memory. But this isn t the case when it comes to Flynn, he explained.  What we have here is a pattern of deceit with Michael Flynn. It s not forgetfulness,  the congressman replied.You can watch the entire interview below, via MSNBC:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 30, 2017"
 Noam Chomsky Warns Of ‘Staged Terrorist Attack’ If Enough People Turn On Trump,"Noam Chomsky has warned us of how dangerous Donald Trump is since the beginning of his campaign. His prediction that Trump would endanger the entire planet by ignoring climate change was confirmed this week when he signed an executive order rolling back President Obama s environmental protections. Now, Chomsky has another warning and it is downright terrifying.Speaking to Alternet, Chomsky said that it is just a matter of time before all of Trump s supporters realize what fraud they actually voted for. I think that sooner or later the white working-class constituency will recognize, and in fact, much of the rural population will come to recognize, that the promises are built on sand. There is nothing there,  the noted scholar said.Chomsky then explained that if Trump s approval ratings falls low enough, we could end up seeing a  staged terrorist attack. I think that we shouldn t put aside the possibility that there would be some kind of staged or alleged terrorist act, which can change the country instantly. A few days later, in an interview with Truthout, Chomsky expanded on what he meant. He explained that Trump could reach a point of sheer desperation to boost his public approval ratings. A terrorist attack would be one way he could try to do that.Chomsky again said that Trump s supporters are waking up and realizing that he lied to them about absolutely everything. Sooner or later, his supporters will turn their backs on him. If that happens, we can expect that the Trump-Bannon crowd will seek to divert attention in one of the many familiar ways   perhaps conjuring up some threat to American security (or if there is one, exploiting it). Or, perhaps, scapegoating the most vulnerable: immigrants, Muslims, welfare recipients (one of Reagan s disgusting techniques), and other available targets,  Chomsky explained.  That could turn very ugly. It could lead to the  friendly fascism  that sociologist Bertram Gross predicted 30 years ago. Or worse. If Chomsky s prediction is correct and Trump ever did try to stage or exploit an attack, it certainly wouldn t be the first time in history this scenario had played out. A perfect example of this is the Vietnam War.In 1964, the USS Maddox was allegedly attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin by the North Vietnamese. This is the incident responsible for officially kicking off the Vietnam War. However, documents released in 2005 and 2006 show that this supposed attack never even happened.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"March 30, 2017"
 Joe Biden Dishes The Real Dirt On GOP Senators Who Refused To Confirm Merrick Garland,"About eight years ago, right about the time a *gasp* black man won the presidency, Republicans chose to stop governing and become known only as the party of destruction obstruction.During the eight years Republicans were holding their collective breaths until they turned orange, they managed to block a lot of pretty common sense legislation, like infrastructure investment and protecting military personnel from losing their children while fighting GOP wars. The most egregious example of GOP obstructionism, though, was toward President Obama s third Supreme Court Pick, Merrick Garland.Joe Biden, in a speech at the newly minted University of Pennsylvania Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, said he spoke to a lot of the Senators and several confessed to him that not giving Garland the up or down vote was a mistake, but they went along with it for the worst possible reason. I call 17 Republicans and say,  You know better,  Biden said Thursday.  Nine of them said to me,  You re right Joe, but I can t do anything about it because if I do the Koch brothers or somebody is going to drop $5 million into my race and I ll lose my primary. Source: PoliticoBiden s solution I something that most of us can agree upon, get money out of politics: You want to change American politics tomorrow? Pass public financing of elections,  Biden said.Republicans actually blamed Biden for their refusal to confirm Garland. They blamed the  Biden rule,  which supposedly said that they shouldn t confirm a lifetime appointment in an election year. Republicans are wrong. Biden did say that election years are contentious times to make a lifetime appointment, but he also said that confirming after the election is just fine. Some will criticize such a decision and say it was nothing more than an attempt to save a seat on the court in the hopes that a Democrat will be permitted to fill it. But that would not be our intention, Mr. President, if that were the course we were to choose in the Senate   to not consider holding hearings until after the election. Instead, it would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is under way, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over.

 BOMBSHELL: Senate Intel Committee Hearing Reveals FRIGHTENING Extent Of Russia’s Meddling,"While the House Intelligence Committee s investigation into Russia s interference in our political process is a mess, the Senate Intelligence Committee is busily working together to conduct their own investigation in as impartial a manner as possible. And today s open hearing revealed a kicker: Russia s meddling with the U.S. government did not stop with the 2016 election.It s actually still going on.Clinton Watts, a senior fellow at the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security, said: This past week we observed social media campaigns targeting speaker of the House Paul Ryan hoping to foment further unrest amongst US democratic institutions. He went on to tell the Senate Intel panel this: They were in full swing during both the Republican and Democratic primary season   and may have helped sink the hopes of candidates more hostile to Russian interests long before the field narrowed. Sen. Rubio, in my opinion, you anecdotally suffered from these efforts. CNN acknowledges that today s hearing may well not be anything like as explosive as James Comey s statement to the House that the FBI is, in fact, investigating Trump for possible collusion with Russia during the election. However, this hearing is focused on Russia s disinformation campaign, which vice-chairman Mark Warner said was a deliberate attempt to undermine our elections.Yesterday, both Warner and Richard Burr, the committee s chairman, said that the committee had an unprecedented number of documents from Congress   Gang of Eight,  which usually severely restricts access to just such information. The Senate Intel Committee is busy trying to learn as much as it can before it calls in high-profile witnesses such as Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and even Jared Kushner and Michael Flynn.They have a list of 20 witnesses they plan to call in so far, but they haven t set dates as to when those witnesses will come in. With Watts  testimony today, though, things could get very interesting very quickly over in the Senate.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"March 30, 2017"
" BREAKING: Michael Flynn Agrees To Testify On Russia In Exchange For Immunity, Trump Is F*cked (DETAILS)","You know how people have been wondering if Michael Flynn has been turned? Well, the Wall Street Journal confirms that Trump s former national security advisor has agreed to testify before Congress in exchange for just one little thing full immunity from prosecution.Just after news broke that an associate of Mr. Flynn s was one of Trump stooge Devin Nunes  sources for the specious secretly-gathered information with which the alleged Trump investigation leader found himself after a middle-of-the-night rendezvous on White House grounds, news broke that Flynn is ready to talk:Mike Flynn, President Donald Trump s former national security adviser, has told the Federal Bureau of Investigation and congressional officials investigating the Trump campaign s potential ties to Russia that he is willing to be interviewed in exchange for a grant of immunity from prosecution, according to officials with knowledge of the matter.As an adviser to Mr. Trump s presidential campaign, and later one of Mr. Trump s top aides in the White House, Mr. Flynn was privy to some of the most sensitive foreign-policy deliberations of the new administration and was directly involved in discussions about the possible lifting of sanctions on Russia imposed by the Obama administration.It seems like Mr. Flynn has been naughty with the Russians, but whatever information he has is something he considers to be of much higher value. While we of course do not yet know what secrets Flynn is currently keeping about the Trump administration s collusion with Russia, it seems safe to assume that this is news The Donald does not want to get out.Naturally, the internet is loving this new development:Michael Flynn should probably stay away from ledges, balconies, pie shops, the back seats of cars, swimming pools, bridges, taco trucks  Wil Wheaton (@wilw) March 30, 2017Flynn just asked for a deal.

" Turncoat Democrats Break Ranks, Back Trump On Stolen SCOTUS Seat (DETAILS)","When one votes for someone with a (D) next to their name, we expect certain things. Namely, in these troubling political times, that they will oppose the bigoted and disturbingly authoritarian Trump agenda at every turn. The problem is, though, that there are Democrats sitting in Congress right now who are acting more like Republicans than Democrats. The most infamous of such figures is one Senator Joe Manchin (DINO-WV). We ve already reported on how Manchin is a complete turncoat who should simply turn in his (D) for an (R) and stop fooling his voters into thinking he s some kind of liberal, because he isn t. Manchin is anti-gay, anti-choice, pro-gun, and pro-coal. Therefore, he is certainly no Democrat in the modern sense of the word, and it should come as no surprise that he is one of two DINOS in the Senate who has announced that he will vote for the Supreme Court nominee to fill the seat that the obstructionist Republicans stole from President Obama. The other turncoat on this issue is Heidi Heitkamp (D- ND).The Hill reports that Heitcamp says of Trump s Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch: After doing my due diligence by meeting with Judge Gorsuch and reviewing his record and testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I ve decided to vote in favor of his confirmation. Heitcamp went on to say that Gorsuch is balanced, meticulous, and [a] well respected jurist who understands the rule of law. She obviously coordinated with Manchin to make this traitorous announcement, as it came just minutes after Manchin said of his own voting in favor of Gorsuch via Twitter: I will vote to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the ninth justice on the Supreme Court.:Luckily, there is already an organization that is actively working to deal with DINOs like Manchin and Heitkamp. Called We Will Replace You, the group is making sure to primary  Democrats  who refuse to oppose the Trump agenda and his disastrous nominees. While any Democrat is better than a Republican, these people need to stick to their guns and do what is right, not what they are being pressured to do by the Trump White House, the red state voters, and the Republicans in Congress. If they refuse to do their jobs on behalf of the Democrats who put them in Congress, they should be primaried   and if the good people at We Will Replace you have their way, all of these  Democrats  who are voting across the aisle will be primaried in 2018.Remember folks   there are plenty of people hiding behind a (D) who are in no way Democrats.

 Devin Nunes’ Credibility Is Officially SHATTERED – New York Times Reveals The Scope Of His Lies,"When Devin Nunes went running to Trump with information that Trump s transition team was caught up in surveillance, he probably didn t think he d get caught in his lies. He probably didn t think that anybody would look into his claim that, while yes, he visited the White House, he absolutely did not get his info from White House staffers. The New York Times did, and now Nunes  entire world is cracking around him.Two of his sources were, in fact, White House staffers with not-insignificant positions. One was Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director of intelligence for the National Security Council who was brought on board by the one and only disgraced Michael Flynn.The other was Michael Ellis, a national security lawyer working in the White House Counsel s office. Ellis once served as a staffer for the House Intelligence Committee.So it s not like Nunes got his info from two low-level, no-name staffers who may or may not know anything real. He got it from high-level security officials within the White House, and now his credibility is shot to hell.The sources who spoke to The New York Times did so on the condition of anonymity, but they did say that the reports that Ellis and Cohen-Watnick were looking at pretty much matched what Nunes said they were. Nunes has insisted from the beginning of the House s Russia investigation that the real problem is who s leaking information, and why he could identify some of the people in the intelligence reports, and not the possibility of high treason.But now that we know he lied about where his sources came from, we have to wonder where his loyalties lie and whether he himself is guilty of treason.While the House Intelligence Committee remains stalled due to Nunes feeling more obligated to Trump than he does to conducting a thorough and impartial investigation, the Senate Intelligence Committee is plugging smoothly on with theirs. At the bare minimum, Nunes needs to recuse himself from this investigation. He really ought to resign his post entirely, though.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"March 30, 2017"
 Pennsylvania Republican Makes Dumbest Claim Yet About Cause Of Climate Change,"Oh. My. God. The stupid, it burns.Anybody who actually paid attention in science class in school are going to have a collective WTF moment when they learn what one Pennsylvania Republican said about the cause of climate change.As we all know by now, Donald Trump signed an executive order reversing every action President Obama took to fight and reverse climate change, a move that has horrified scientists around the globe.But just as cringe-worthy is what Scott Wagner told a group of county officials on Tuesday. Wagner is a GOP state senator who wants to be Pennsylvania s next governor. Unlike Donald Trump, he acknowledges that climate change is real. However, his view on what causes climate change is far different than what any actual scientist has concluded.According to Wagner, climate change is happening because of two different reasons. First, he claimed that it s happening because of body heat. Seriously. We have more people. You know, humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off? Things are changing, but I think we are, as a society, doing the best we can. Humans have warm bodies but it s not our body heat that is causing climate change. It s all the pollution we harmful gases we expel into the atmosphere like methane and carbon dioxide. Also, reversing climate action is not  doing the best we can.  Ending the fight against climate change threatens our country, especially our coastlines, which will likely end up under water unless we do something fast to prevent sea level rise caused by climate change.But then Wagner suggested another cause for climate change and this one makes it clear that Republicans need to pick up a f*cking science book. I haven t been in a science class in a long time, but the earth moves closer to the sun every year   you know, the rotation of the earth,  Wagner said.  We re moving closer to the sun. Again, this is a guy who wants to occupy the top government office in Pennsylvania.And Wagner is absolutely wrong.As Huffington Post reports,Contrary to what Wagner said, the earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours, not every year. And it may come as a surprise to him that the United States and the rest of the Northern Hemisphere experience winter when the earth s yearly orbit brings it closest to the sun.Furthermore, Wagner made it sound like the Earth s orbit around the sun is decaying. But it definitely is not decaying. If anything, the sun would become a red giant and swallow the Earth. And that probably won t happen for millions of years long after climate change kills us all because Republicans like Donald Trump and Scott Wagner deny climate change and its cause.After his embarrassing remarks went viral, Wagner released a statement somewhat acknowledging that humans have contributed to climate change. I believe that the climate is changing every day, and some of that change is certainly manmade. I think that we have a responsibility to future generations to be good stewards, and I support efforts to do that. However, the real question isn t is the climate changing but what role should the government play in trying to alter it. I believe we have to prioritize action in a measured way so that we do not hurt our economy. The problem is that climate change will do more to hurt our economy than the measures employed to stop it ever will. One would think saving the planet would be the number one priority. But as usual, Republicans are thinking more about the wallets of billionaires.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"March 30, 2017"
 Trump Threatens To ‘Change Libel Laws’ To Sue People Who Criticize Him In Twitter Meltdown,"Here s another hole in the leaky ship that is the argument Trump shouldn t be taken  literally  when he makes threats. Trump has circled back to his campaign promise to make changes to libel laws that would allow him to go after journalists and news organizations which publish things he doesn t like. He held out for less than three months.Trump s rediscovered love of censorship comes on the heels of several straight days of Trump freaking out about the New York Times reporting on his various scandals. And it s probably no coincidence that Trump is reconsidering press freedom right as his approval rating hits historic lows (the worst since Nixon was impeached and a record low for any president at this stage in office).In a culmination of Trump s rant against the New York Times, he called for a change in libel laws and used an article written by the New York Post   a right-leaning daily owned by Rupert Murdoch   to pretend his troubles are due to the  liberal media  and not his own incompetence.The failing @nytimes has disgraced the media world. Gotten me wrong for two solid years. Change libel laws? https://t.co/QIqLgvYLLi  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017The article shows how thoroughly unserious it is just three sentences in when it repeats the lie that the New York Times  apologized  to readers for being so biased against Trump. The paper did no such thing. The only other person who routinely suggests that it did is none other than Trump himself. The relationship between the New York Post and Donald Trump is an orange-painted echo chamber.Trump s belief that he can pass libel laws to restrict what the press says about him is terrifying, but not original. He made similar remarks during the campaign. Here s Trump channeling a dictator in February 2016: One of the things I m going to do if I win, and I hope we do and we re certainly leading. I m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money. We re going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they re totally protected. As the old adage goes, he told us who he was, we should have believed him.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"March 30, 2017"
 ‘He Feels Great’: Spicer Says Trump Not Concerned Taxpayers Pay For Mar-a-Lago Trips,"Amateur president Donald Trump isn t concerned in the least about the rising costs associated with his regular trips to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said during a press briefing on Wednesday.A reporter asked if Trump has  any concerns about the pushback  from Florida residents and taxpayers about the costs of his trips there. No, he feels great,  Spicer replied.Spicer tried to defend Trump by saying that his boss stayed in Washington, D.C., last weekend and said that the alleged president plans to remain in town this weekend as well, according to MSN.Trump has spent at least five weekends at Mar-a-Lago since his inauguration only nine weeks ago. The former reality show star repeatedly criticized former President Barack Obama for going on golf outings and/or taking vacations. However, if Trump continues taking weekend vacations at his current pace, he is set to outspend President Obama s entire eight years of vacation costs in just under one year. Spicer, however, explained recently that it s alright for Trump to go on golf trips but not Obama because the current occupant of the White House conducts meetings while he s golfing.Business owners near Mar-a-Lago are going broke because of Trump s frequent visits. The cost of Trump s visits to the area is costing the state a ton of money. That means, like the wall, the taxpayers are footing the bill.Travel and security costs associated with the trips to his resort is through the roof. On top of that, this is a burden for the Secret Service.In 2015, Trump said that if elected, he would,  rarely leave the White House because there s so much work to be done.

 CNN Host STUNNED As Trump Voters Expose Just How Stupid They Are In Interview (VIDEO),"Much like Donald Trump himself, it s hard to tell what kinds of insane things might happen during an interview with the people who support the incompetent POTUS. CNN s Alisyn Camerota learned this the hard way on Thursday morning when she interviewed a few Trump voters about how they thought he was doing after his several weeks in office. The experience may have left a permanent scar.Despite having the failures, investigations and exposed lies, this focus group of Trump voters gave Trump an  A  grade   all but 1 voter in the group of 6 had the balls to give Trump a  B  because he refused to give out the highest grade. That voter, Billy Baer, said: It was like people were laughing in his face   literally laughing in his face   about the prospect of him being elected. He got elected, and we don t know, as far as the votes and fraud and everything else. My assumption is that he probably would have been elected by a higher number than what the results actually showed. While giving a clearly failing and highly unpopular POTUS an A or B is puzzling in itself, the real shocking moment came when Camerota challenged the Trump supporters on Trump s claim that millions of people had voted illegally in the election. This is where Baer insisted he saw busloads of people from out of state coming into New Hampshire to vote. Camerota questioned this obviously bullsh*t claim and asked: When you say you ve seen it, do you mean dozens or do you mean 3 million? There s a difference. Baer then admitted he hadn t seen 3 million illegal voters, even though this has been the number Trump s been touting despite having no evidence. Baer replied: Extrapolating, based on the number I ve seen with my own eyes, busloads of people coming in   whether they re illegal, meaning they came into the country illegally, or they re illegal voters   they came over from Massachusetts into New Hampshire. When Camerota asked Baer just how he d seen  busloads and busloads , another Trump supporter chimed in to deliver the final blow of insanity. Josh Youssef jumped in and said,  Who cares, though? , solidifying that the truth and facts do not matter at all to anyone who supports Trump. Camerota was visibly stunned and said: I care. Just to be clear, you saw it with your own eyes, busloads and busloads of people coming from somewhere other than New Hampshire to vote. You saw that? Youssef tried to defend Trump and said: I ve seen cars coming in from out of state that are full, with out-of-state plates   I live right across the street from the polling place in my ward. And not surprisingly, Baer s claims also didn t hold up. He eventually said: Yeah, I guess that I can t cite the busloads that I ve seen and where I ve seen them, but on television I ve seen it. Well, we know that Trump also gets all of his  facts  from television   the mostly false Fox News to be exact   so this makes perfect sense.

 The CREEPY Way Pence’s Religion Demands He Treat Women Will Make You SICK (DETAILS),"Mike Pence is a devout Evangelical Christian. There s nothing wrong with that; after all, that s what the First Amendment is for. However, it seems that Trump s vice president takes his piety to a whole new, incredibly creepy level. First, there is the way he treats his wife.Reports of a dinner Pence had with state senators while he was still Governor of Indiana are most alarming. Apparently, during the dinner, it was revealed that Pence actually calls his wife  mother.  It seems that at first, people thought it was a cute joke or something, but then came to realize that he was completely serious. Pence reportedly yelled down the table at his wife repeatedly during the meal. From Rolling Stone:Gov. Pence shouted to his wife, Karen, his closest adviser, at the other end of the table. Mother, Mother, who prepared our meal this evening? The legislators looked at one another, speaking with their eyes: He just called his wife  Mother. Maybe it was a joke, the legislator reasoned. But a few minutes later, Pence shouted again. Mother, Mother, whose china are we eating on? Mother Pence went on a long discourse about where the china was from. A little later, the legislators stumbled out, wondering what was weirder: Pence s inability to make conversation, or calling his wife  Mother  in the second decade of the 21st century.As if that weren t bad enough, it seems that there are even creepier rules with regards to how Pence treats women other than his wife. In fact, according to New York Magazine, Pence is not allowed to dine alone with any woman who is not his wife, Karen Pence. Supposedly, Karen Pence is her husband s  gut check  and  prayer warrior,  and is therefore rarely away from her husband. Unsurprisingly, though, we never hear her speak. Perhaps she is not allowed to. Hell, Pence won t even go to any sort of gathering where there is booze on the menu unless Karen is right there.So, if Pence is not allowed to be in a room with any woman who is not his wife, then how on earth does he do government business if the adviser happens to be a woman? Does his wife get to be in the Situation Room? Does she get top level clearances? Are they allowed to use  religious liberty  as the reason for such accommodations? Time will only tell. What we do know is that Mike Pence and his wife get creepier by the day, and that is very bad for America.The only consolation is that it sure as hell explains a lot   but the more we learn about these creepy people, the scarier America s situation becomes.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"March 30, 2017"

 Black Caucus Just Broke It Down For Paul Ryan: Time To Get Rid Of Nunes As Intel Committee Chair,"The Congressional Black Caucus just broke it down for House Speaker Paul Ryan, explaining to him in no uncertain terms that Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) obviously can t be trusted and needs to be removed as chairman of the Intelligence Committee. This action is necessary in order to meet the public s expectation that Congress conducts an impartial investigation into a matter that threatens the core of our democracy,  the CBC wrote in a statement issued Wednesday. Congressman Nunes  recent actions have caused him to lose the confidence of members of his committee, and, more importantly, the American people, and he can no longer be trusted with the information that the committee receives. Some lawmakers are calling for Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Others, like the CBC, are calling on Ryan to remove him as intel chair altogether. The caucus is also demanding that a special  bipartisan commission  be formed to handle the probe into Russia s election meddling and Trump s possible collusion. Congress must create an independent, bipartisan commission to expose the full truth about any and all Trump-Russia connections and collusion,  the statement reads.  The American people want and deserve to know if their government has been compromised by the Kremlin. The Black Caucus is not alone. Democrats have been calling on Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation into Russia s interference in the presidential election. He landed himself in hot water last week when he decided it would be a great idea to announce that intelligence on Donald Trump had been gathered accidentally while monitoring other people of interest, such as the Russian ambassador, without bothering to mention it to the committee first.All hell broke loose when Nunes then decided he should brief Trump on the matter. To make matters worse, it later came out that he secretly visited the White House the night before the announcement was made, leading some to question where his information came from in the first place.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"March 29, 2017"
 This Man Has The PERFECT Response To House GOP’s Attempt To Destroy Internet Privacy,"Congress has been working on rolling back an Obama-era rule that protected us from having our internet histories bought, sold, and broadcast; and people are understandably upset considering the GOP s ongoing pretense that privacy is everything. The rule hadn t gone into effect, but it would have given us more control over what our ISPs can do with our information than we currently have.The GOP doesn t want that rule to go into effect, and Max Temkin, one of the founders of the party game  Cards Against Humanity,  has made a vow that Congress would be wise to heed, since Temkin has an awful lot of money:If this shit passes I will buy the browser history of every congressman and congressional aide and publish it. cc @SpeakerRyan https://t.co/cOL3mx6JuG  Max Temkin (@MaxTemkin) March 27, 2017It s a strong,  in your face, how do you like it?  move. The point that Temkin is trying to make here is that, if Congressional Republicans are willing to allow companies to buy and sell our information, compromising our privacy, then they should know exactly what that feels like. The ISPs and the GOP both feel that this restriction was unfair, given that it wouldn t have applied to major websites like Google and Facebook.So, of course, we should get rid of this rule instead of leveling the playing field and preventing Google and Facebook (and other sites) from likewise collecting and selling our data. Industry groups framed their argument like so: It set out an overbroad definition of sensitive data that doesn t apply to non-ISP s collecting as much or more personal data online. And as we all know, privacy shouldn t be about who collects information, it should be about what information is collected and how it is used. The truth is that Republicans have been getting a lot of money from the telecom industry, and they only care about privacy when it doesn t adversely affect their handlers. Maybe if they re the first to have their data sold and exposed, they ll think twice about their selective brand of privacy advocacy.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"March 29, 2017"
 Donald Trump ‘SHOCKED’ A Group Of Women Have Heard Of One Of The Most Famous Women In History (VIDEO),"For some reason, Donald Trump decided to speak to a group of women at a women s empowerment event on Wednesday, on one of the final days of Women s History Month. It didn t go well.First he bragged about the number of women in his cabinet. There are six women. Out of 24. That s 25 percent. Less than half of what would be representative of the nation as a whole. It s also the whitest and most male cabinet since Ronald Reagan.It got worse. Trump went on to name women, famous women, although there s no indication that Trump knew why many of them were famous. The first part wasn t soooooo bad: Since the very beginning, women have driven, and I mean, each generation of Americans, towards a more free and more prosperous future,  Trump said.  These patriots are women like the legendary Abigail Adams, right? Who, during the founding, urged her husband to remember the rights of women. She was very much a pioneer in that way. We ve been blessed with courageous heroes like Harriet Tubman who escaped slavery. And went on to deliver hundreds of others to freedom, first in the underground railroad and then as a spy for the union army. She was very, very courageous, believe me. Source: Raw StoryIt very quickly became clear he was out of his intellectual element when he completed that thought with:Around we ve had leaders like Susan B. Anthony. Have you heard of Susan B. Anthony? I m shocked that you ve heard of her   who dreamed of a much more fair and equal future and an America where women themselves as she said helped to make laws and elect the lawmakers, and that s what s happening more and more. Of course, it s not shocking at all that a group of women have in fact heard of the suffragette and all around social justice warrior. There was even a coin with her face on it, but to be fair, it s doubtful Trump carries cash. Other people pay all of his bills.Trump, though, had clearly never heard of Anthony, at least before someone briefed him right before the event.Here s the video:Perhaps Trump s handlers (whoever they are) need to remind the orange dictator that he should never, ever speak to people who aren t white and male.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 29, 2017"
 Married GOP Lawmaker And Trump Campaign Member BUSTED In Hotel With Teenage Boy,"As if Donald Trump needs help delegitimizing his party, a senior member of his campaign in Oklahoma, state Senator Ralph Shortey, was forced to resign after being caught in a hotel room with a 17-year-old male prostitute.In true Trump style, Shortey tried to spin the encounter as him just helping the kid earn some money for his Spring Break by letting the kid earn his way with  sexual stuff. In online messages, he told him:  I m gonna f**k you like a good little boy if you keep calling me daddy. He also referred to having sex with the teen s  boy p*ssy, baby boy .Source: Pink NewsAccording to court documents, Shortey was reported by a friend of the boy, who saw him getting into an SUV. The friend followed them to the hotel room, where he saw the boy enter with a strange man. The friend called the teen s father, who called the police.While the age of consent in Oklahoma is only 16, having sex with a prostitute under 18 is something else altogether. Shortey has been charged with engaging in child prostitution, engaging in prostitution within 1,000 feet of a church and transporting a minor for prostitution. All the charges are felonies. He s out on $100,000 bail.Here s the video:Shortey s statement following resignation fell short of admitting to his crimes, instead calling them  a distraction. Earlier today, I submitted my resignation, effective immediately, to the President Pro Tempore of the Oklahoma Senate, as well as to Governor Fallin. I thank the constituents of Senate District 44 for the opportunity they provided to serve. Because I take that responsibility seriously, I recognize that the charges against me are a distraction to their interests and the remaining legislative session, which should serve all Oklahomans. My resignation is evidence of my respect for public service and the duties of our elected officials. I ask for the privacy of my family   my wife and four daughters   as I defend myself of these charges.Source: KFOR ",News,"March 29, 2017"
 Trump’s Approval Rating Makes SHOCKING Change With His Own Supporters (IMAGE),"Donald Trump likes to whine about any poll that doesn t show him in a favorable light, calling the data  biased  or  dishonest    but here s one poll that he cannot ignore.A new Politico/Morning Consult poll covering numbers as recent as March 24-25 shows that Trump s approval ratings are plummeting   even among his own supporters. Trump has been shown to be failing in more balance polls, which is no surprise   but to see his support dwindling so quickly among Republicans is quite shocking. According to the data, Trump s ratings are now as follows: Overall, 38 percent of voters strongly disapprove of Trump, compared to only 23 percent who strongly approve. To make matters even worse for Trump, this national tracking poll had a tendency to lean pro-Trump, which made the findings far higher than a more balanced poll like Gallup s most recent data, which shows Trump s approval rating at a pathetic 38%.It appears as though Trump s disastrous failure with the American Health Care Act (Trumpcare) had an extremely negative impact on his approval rating, which fell 6% points among his own supporters. The Politico/Morning Consult poll reported: The decline in Trump s approval rating was sharper among Republicans and independents than among Democrats. In the latest survey, 81 percent of Republicans and 39 percent of independents approve of the job Trump is doing. A week prior, 85 percent of GOP voters and 44 percent approved. And among those who self-identified as Trump voters last year, the president s approval rating shrunk from 90 percent last week to 84 percent this week. However, it s not just Trump s health care debacle that is impacting his numbers so much   his Russia scandal is also working against him: Twenty-nine percent of voters call Russia an  enemy  of the U.S., and 30 percent say it is an unfriendly nation. Only 7 percent call Russia an  ally,  and another 22 percent say it s friendly but not an ally. Five weeks ago, voters were divided evenly on whether Russia was friendly toward the United States. Trump was an extremely unpopular president to begin with, and he has failed to redeem or prove himself to the American people. In fact, he hasn t even tried   and his supporters are catching on. They ve practically disappeared and seem ashamed to defend him after his corruption, humiliating behavior, and broken campaign promises have come to light. With numbers this pathetic, Trump and his policies don t stand a chance.Featured image via Gage Skidmore / Flickr",News,"March 29, 2017"
 Trump Official Accidentally Leaks Plan To Steal Land From Mexico For Border Wall,"Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto may not be too happy once he hears of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke s plan to make that border wall thing happen. You see, the terrain on our southern border isn t exactly the most uniform thing in the universe and at times there may be complications   like the Rio Grande River.E&E News reports that Zinke told a crowd at an event held by Public Lands Council this week that the Trump administration didn t want to build the wall on American soil because it would mean handing the entire Rio Grande river to Mexico   so he just wants to take the land instead: The border is complicated, as far as building a physical wall. The Rio Grande, what side of the river are you going to put the wall? We re not going to put it on our side and cede the river to Mexico. And we re probably not going to put it in the middle of the river. Zinke stopped just shy of saying that we d take the land by force, but he made it pretty clear that the United States isn t going to give up the river   and Mexico isn t going to hand over land on their side to build a gigantic ugly wall on the border. First, President Trump proposed building a wall on our southern border and having Mexico pay for it. Now his administration is planning to build a wall in Mexico and have Americans pay for it,  Austin Evers, executive director of watchdog group Americans Oversight, said in a statement following the remarks.Will Trump s agenda lead us to war with one of our allies? If the administration has its way, according to Zinke, that s exactly what will happen.featured image via screengrab",News,"March 29, 2017"
 Trump DEVASTATED After Poll Reveals Americans Trust Media More Than Him (TWEET),"It was just this morning that Donald Trump once again tried to ignore his mounting failures and pump up his ego by trashing the press. Taking to Twitter, the undeserving POTUS bashed the New York Times (again) with yet another one of his lies. And after Trump trashed the New York Times, he posted another tweet about the  vicious  and inaccurate media:If the people of our great country could only see how viciously and inaccurately my administration is covered by certain media!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2017However, thanks to a new poll released by Monmouth University, Trump s temper tantrums about the press are far from over, because he seems to be alone in his opinion. The Monmouth University poll revealed that thanks to Trump s numerous lies and falsehoods, Americans now view MSNBC as a more credible source than him!You can only imagine how devastating it is for Trump to realize that his attacks on  fake news  are actually working against him and HELPING networks that dare to publish the truth about him. The poll stated: Only 28% of Americans are more likely trust Trump as an information source compared to ABC news while most (53%) say they would tend to trust ABC more, with 15% saying they would trust both sides equally. When pitted against MSNBC, 33% trust Trump more while 47% trust the liberal leaning cable channel more, with 15% trusting both about equally. When pitted against Fox News, only 17% trust Trump more while 37% trust the politically conservative news outlet more, with 36% trusting both about equally. Another interesting but not surprising finding from the poll was the fact that networks like MSNBC and ABC were viewed as more credible than Fox News, which has previously been outed as the most dishonest network (which is likely why Trump cites them so much). The only area where Trump is actually succeeding in credibility is among Republicans, who tend to take Trump s nonsense as the truth. The poll reported: The story is different, though, when isolating the views of Republicans. Americans who identify as GOP partisans are more likely to have confidence in Trump over any of the news sources tested in the poll. This is especially true for MSNBC   Trump is more trusted by a 66% to 16% margin   and ABC News   Trump is more trusted by a 56% to 22% margin. The president even has a slight, although statistically insignificant, 29% to 26% trust advantage over Fox News among his fellow partisans, with 44% of Republicans saying they trust both equally as an information source. So, Trump basically screwed himself over by trying to damage the credibility of the free press. While it s somewhat satisfying to see his attacks on the media backfire, we must not forget that what Trump s ridiculous behavior has resulted in is extremely dangerous. The White House now has no credibility, which could be devastating in the event that something serious happens. No one can trust the president, and he has undermined the credibility of the government. It will take a long time to repair this and rebuild the trust of the American people.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"March 29, 2017"
 The New York Times Just FIRED BACK At Trump With Brutal Fact-Check On Twitter,"Donald Trump pissed off The New York Times, and that mistake bit him on the ass.On Tuesday morning, Trump attacked the newspaper by once again falsely referring to it as  failing  and posting a link to an opinion piece written by a person who canceled his subscription because he s a snowflake who couldn t handle the honest coverage of Trump.The failing @NYTimes would do much better if they were honest! https://t.co/ATy8R3knS2  Donald J.

You know, because the truth hurts.If the people of our great country could only see how viciously and inaccurately my administration is covered by certain media!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2017Trump was likely referring to a letter addressed to subscribers written by publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., who acknowledged that the newspaper had underestimated Trump and the amount of support he had among conservatives.Of course, it wasn t just The New York Times that got it wrong. Multiple news outlets across the media got it wrong. Then again, maybe they were right. We ll just never know since Russia interfered in the election on Trump s behalf and FBI Director James Comey dropped an October surprise on Hillary Clinton that damaged her campaign despite the  new evidence  being worthless. After all, Trump lost the popular vote by three million votes and squeaked out one of the narrowest Electoral College wins in American history.Anyway, nowhere in the letter did Sulzberger apologize for the coverage Times reporters and journalist provided on the election and Trump s budding scandals.That s why The New York Times fired back at Trump two hours after his tweet on Wednesday morning to slam him for lying..@realdonaldtrump False, we did not apologize.

 WATCH: Conservationist Jane Goodall BLASTS Trump’s Attack On Climate Science,"Donald Trump s roll-back of actions designed to fight climate change horrified the legendary conservationist.Jane Goodall is famous for her longtime studies of apes and chimpanzees.During the 2016 campaign, Goodall put this expertise to good use by comparing Trump to the chimpanzees she researched. In many ways the performances of Donald Trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals,  Goodall said.  In order to impress rivals, males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays: stamping, slapping the ground, dragging branches, throwing rocks. The more vigorous and imaginative the display, the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy, and the longer he is likely to maintain that position. And she was right. Trump s ape-like behavior thrilled his supporters and sent him to the White House where he has embarrassed himself and the nation so much that many Americans probably wish an actual chimpanzee had won instead of him, especially after what Trump did earlier this week.As a conservationist, Goodall has traveled the world and witnessed the effects of climate change firsthand.So when Trump signed yet another executive order to reverse rules put in in place by President Obama to slow down or reverse the effects of climate change, hr usual optimism soured.Referring to Trump s executive order as  immensely depressing,  Goodall expressed how sad it is that the United States is declining to play its part to save the world. Many of us, not just my institute but many, we ve been working really hard to create the Paris agreement and global efforts to cut emissions,  Goodall told journalists.  Thinking that the USA isn t going to play its part, such an industrial country, is really very, very sad. And it means we re going to have to work harder. Indeed, while the United States is not the only nation in the world, our influence on the international stage is critical to any agreement of between countries, especially when it comes to financial, technological, and military resources.Trump s irresponsible order to reverse our nation s involvement in fighting climate change not only threatens the rest of the world, it threatens America as well, especially our coastlines, which are in danger of being under several feet of water due to sea level rise caused by increasingly melting ice caps.Trump s beloved Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida will be under water in the near future if we do not act now.But Trump had adopted the conservative line that climate change is not real and that science is fake. He s a climate change denier, and Jane Goodall has zero tolerance for that stance. I would not dream of refuting the science that shows climate change is happening,  Goodall said.  It s happening everywhere. It s already having devastating effects in many parts of the world. The droughts are getting worse, flooding s getting worse. Storms, hurricanes are getting more frequent and more violent. And the main thing is unpredictability. Everywhere I go, people say,  Well it s not normally like that at this time of year. And Trump s attack on climate action is causing scientists to lose hope. There is definitely a feeling of gloom and doom among all the people I know,  Goodall continued.  If we allow this feeling of doom and gloom to continue, then it will be very, very bad. But my job is to give people hope. Bu despite her high hopes that we can push back and reinstate the climate actions, even Goodall conceded that she sees the future of our children and grandchildren  being unraveled  right before our eyes by a man who doesn t care about thing or anyone but himself. Even a chimpanzee would have more compassion.Featured Image: Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"March 29, 2017"
 The Latest Delusion From Devin Nunes Will Make You SICK — This Is Exactly Why He Can’t Be Trusted,"Representative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that the Democrats are  not serious  about the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election. We re beginning to figure out who s actually serious about the investigation because it appears like the Democrats aren t really serious about this investigation,  he told reporters, according to Politico.This is the same Nunes who snuck onto the White House grounds to meet an unnamed source last week, then switched cars and ditched aides, then vanished into the night so that the next day he could make an announcement to defend alleged president Donald Trump. Nunes, while refusing to name his source, said that he had seen evidence that Trump associates were  incidentally  surveilled after the election.The top Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, and other Democrats, are calling for Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Nunes has refused to do so.Nunes alleges that the Democrats have not given him a witness list and added that as far as he knew they had done  very little  to read the documents provided by the intelligence agencies, according to Politico. So, at the end of the day here, we re going to get to the truth, we re going to find out who s actually doing a real investigation,  Nunes said.Nunes, who literally went around the very committee he chairs, to bring Trump  evidence  amid one of the biggest scandals to ever hit the White House, claims that Democrats aren t serious about a probe into Russia s meddling of our election.Sure, accuse the other side of what you re guilty of, Rep. Nunes.So far, only one Republican lawmaker has stepped forward to call for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation. Hopefully, more Republicans will locate their conscience in order to disallow a hostile foreign government from underminding our election process in the future.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,"March 29, 2017"
" Fox News Just Got SLAPPED With A Racial Discrimination Lawsuit, And It’s About Damn Time","Years of racism in the workplace has finally resulted in a long overdue lawsuit against Fox News.On the same day that Fox host Bill O Reilly made an outrageously racist comment about Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and a week after news broke that Fox fired comptroller Judith Slater for making racist remarks to black employees, a racial discrimination lawsuit was formally filed against the network by two African-American women who experienced the racism firsthand.According to The New York Times,The women   Tichaona Brown, a payroll manager, and Tabrese Wright, a payroll coordinator   accused Ms. Slater of making numerous racially charged comments, including suggestions that black men were  women beaters  and that black people wanted to physically harm white people.They also said that Ms. Slater claimed that black employees mispronounced words, such as  mother,   father,   month  and  ask,  and that she urged Ms. Brown to say those words aloud in a meeting. Ms. Wright said Ms. Slater once asked if her three children were all  fathered by the same man. The lawsuit was filed in State Supreme Court in the Bronx and the attorneys representing the two ladies are  confident  that Fox is not going to like the outcome if they go to court. We are confident that the good men and women of the Bronx will hold Fox accountable for what we believe to be its abhorrent racist conduct, reminiscent of the Jim Crow era,  they said in a joint statement.Of course, Fox News whined about the lawsuit in a statement to Raw Story.We take complaints of this nature very seriously and took prompt and effective remedial action before Ms. Brown and Ms. Wright sued in court and even before Ms. Wright complained through her lawyer. There is no place for inappropriate verbal remarks like this at Fox News. We are disappointed that this needless litigation has been filed.Frankly, it s about damn time Fox News faced a lawsuit like this. The network s record of racism and racist remarks has been atrocious over the years, especially since the election of the President Obama in 2008.Bill O Reilly and Sean Hannity have been especially guilty of being racist, yet unlike Slater, they remain employed by the network.O Reilly has even been named in sexual harassment lawsuits but Fox executives still keep paying him to run his mouth every night.Fox News is pretty much saying that it s okay if their on-air personalities are sexist and racist but it s not okay for their executives who work behind the scenes. Sounds like a double standard.But the sexism and racism at Fox News is now catching up to them as former and current employees are starting to fight back by filing lawsuits. At some point, Fox News is going to have to drag itself and their employees into the 21st century before they go broke trying to defend themselves in court.Featured Image: Dangerous Minds",News,"March 29, 2017"

Just look at all that s happened in the last few days to women who were simply doing their jobs,  Clinton told the crowd, cutting into White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for the condescending attitude he had toward a reporter who shook her head as Spicy lied to her: April Ryan, a respected journalist with unrivaled integrity, was doing her job just this afternoon in the White House press room when she was patronized and cut off trying to ask a question. Clinton also took aim at Trump ally, Fox News host Bill O Reilly, for his insanely racist joke about a black congresswoman s hair: One of our own California congressmen Maxine Waters was taunted with a racist joke about her hair. Too many women, especially women of color, have had a lifetime of practice taking precisely these kinds of indignities in stride. But why should we have to?  Clinton asked rhetorically.  And any woman who thinks this couldn t be directed at her is living in a dream world.

 Makers Of Fake Planned Parenthood Baby Parts Video Slapped With 15 Felony Charges,"Two anti-abortion activists are facing 15 felony charges after they secretly filmed themselves trying to buy aborted fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood. (In case you missed it, these attempts were unsuccessful because, duh. But that didn t stop them from editing this video footage and then using it to claim that the women s health provider was selling baby parts. They weren t.)State Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced the charges against David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt on Tuesday. The Associated Press reports:The allegations say the pair filmed 14 people without permission between October 2013 and July 2015 in Los Angeles, San Francisco and El Dorado counties. One felony count was filed for each person. The 15th was for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy.According to Becerra, Daleiden and Merritt created a fictitious biomedical research company, which they then lied about in order to convince representatives of Planned Parenthood to meet with them   and then they secretly recorded them without their knowledge.Daleiden claims these charges are  bogus  and are only being brought against him because of Planned Parenthood s political cronies.  Naturally. The public knows the real criminals are Planned Parenthood and their business partners,  Daleiden said. (For the record, the women s health care provider has committed zero crimes.)Last April, Daleiden claimed on social media that his home had been raided by agents from the California Department of Justice who confiscated all his video footage, among other things. There had been no word on the investigation since then until the charges were filed with the San Francisco Superior Court on Tuesday.In January of 2016, Daleiden and Merritt were both indicted on similar charges by a grand jury in Texas. That grand jury had originally been convened to investigate Planned Parenthood, but not only did they find no wrongdoing on the part of the women s health care provider, they also ended up indicting the filmmakers for their bogus video. Unfortunately, these charges were dropped because the prosecutor said the jury had overstepped since this was not why they were convened.Featured image via Eric Kayne/Getty Images",News,"March 28, 2017"
 Trump Stooge Nunes Just Gave the Most Immature Answer When Asked If He Will Recuse Himself (VIDEO),"Trump transition team member Devin Nunes, who inexplicably is leading the congressional investigation into Trump s ties with Russia, recently got himself in a spot of trouble when he met with a source he will not reveal on the White House grounds in the middle of the night on Wednesday to obtain sketchy intel that seems intended to back Trump s claim that President Obama  tapped  his  wires. Nunes claims that he was shown U.S. surveillance documents that indicate numerous members of the Trump team were indirectly surveilled when they contacted some shady foreign people who were being investigated. Instead of taking this information, which may or may not be true as the alleged Trump investigator refuses to show his work, to his fellow investigators Nunes admits he ran straight to the main subject of the investigation.By Thursday, Nunes was scrambling to apologize for corrupting the investigation by leaking details to the guy he s supposed to be investigating amid calls for him to recuse himself. But Nunes refuses to do so despite a clear conflict of interest.On Wednesday, CNN caught up to Nunes to ask if he will recuse himself and he decided the appropriate response was that of a third-grader:This is the mentality of the people with whom we are dealing   they are like children who have been handed too much power and are f*cking evil. But really, what did we expect given that Nunes  boss regularly employs the  I know you are but what am I?  and  But teacher, he hit me too  defenses.Watch it below:Instead of recusing himself from the #TrumpRussia investigation, @DevinNunes insults and denies   just like @realDonaldTrump. #Russiagate pic.twitter.com/0NNWxeygT7  American Bridge (@American_Bridge) March 28, 2017featured image via screengrab",News,"March 28, 2017"
 April Ryan Describes In Harrowing Detail What It Feels Like To Be Abused By Sean Spicer (VIDEO),"By now, everyone is aware of the appallingly abusive way in which White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer treated American Urban Radio Correspondent April Ryan during Tuesday s White House Press briefing. All Ryan was doing was, well, HER JOB, and asking about the cloud of Russia investigations hanging over the embattled Trump Administration. This caused Sean Spicer to completely lose it, and launch into condescending, sexist, and racist attacks on Ryan.After the press availability was over, Ryan spoke with MSNBC s Katy Tur about her experience, addressing the accusation from Sean Spicer that she was pushing an agenda rather than just reporting the facts. Ryan told Tur: I don t have an agenda. We ve never seen anything like this before and my question was simple, how do you change the perception problem? And it went off into this Russian dressing, no shaking my head or whatever. You cannot ignore, as a reporter, there are issues on Capitol Hill. You have investigations going. You have the head of the intel committee coming here to the White House briefing people, the president himself. I understand what Sean is doing  trying to make this administration look better than what it does right now. And unfortunately, I was roadkill today. No matter what Sean Spicer s job is, he had not right to treat April Ryan that way. She was just doing her job. If he can t handle tough questions, he should find another line of work. To flat-out deny all of those investigations, and to accuse the press of being at fault for the fact that the criminal activity that is clearly taking place inside the Trump White House is a huge story is truly beyond the pale. Until they come clean about the Russia business, this will continue to be a story. The White House Press Corp would derelict in their duties if they didn t continue to press Spicer on this.Good on you for being a superb member of the Fourth Estate, Ms. Ryan.

" Trump Says He Never Makes Mistakes, Then Immediately Makes A Mistake (VIDEO)","In perhaps the clearest example of the small, but egregious way Donald Trump lies about even the little things, he got caught screwing up less than 2 seconds after announcing that he  doesn t make mistakes. It unfolded like a scene from a comedy, Trump, angry at his plummeting poll numbers and numerous scandals, complained that the press were obsessed with looking for flaws in his White House. Rather than admit he s only human, Trump doubled down on his absurd contention that he s never wrong. One mistake and it s no good. But we just can t make mistakes, right? So we don t make mistakes. Ready for the punchline?Trump next passes the conversation over to  Ken. Go ahead, Ken. That wasn t  Ken.  That s Chuck Canterbury, the head of the National Fraternal Order of Police.Oops.While flatly stating that you never make mistakes is a ridiculous thing to lie about, it only serves to highlight the general level of dishonesty that is rampant in Trump s White House. He s so incapable of admitting he s wrong that Trump goes to great lengths to never apologize for anything he s ever said   no matter how false. Trump never apologized for linking Ted Cruz s dad to the JFK assassination. His  apology  for six years of promoting birtherism turned out to be a  sorry, not sorry  publicity stunt. He can t even admit his unfounded claim that Obama wiretapped his phones was a complete fabrication.But here s the really scary part. A lie as obvious as  I never make mistakes  brings us to an unsettling truism: If a person will lie about the little things, what will he do to cover up the big ones?Featured image via YouTube",News,"March 28, 2017"
 WATCH: Lindsey Graham LAYS INTO Devin Nunes – Time To Let The Grownups Handle This,"Senator Lindsey Graham is on the attack after Nunes blew the credibility of the House Intel Committee s investigation into collusion with Russia. He appeared on NBC s  Today  show this morning to tell the entire world exactly what he thinks of Nunes at this point, and he didn t hold anything back: I think it s a little bizarre. There s nothing been revealed to suggest the Obama administration surveilled the Trump campaign. That s not even what Nunes is saying. He s saying there s incidental collection outside of Russia.The problem he s created is he s gone out on a lark by himself, sort of an Inspector Clouseau investigation here, trying to find some unmasking information about collection incidental with the Trump campaign and some foreign agent outside of Russia. I think the only way this can be repaired is if he tells his colleagues on the House Intelligence committee who he met with and what he saw. Graham wants Nunes to do the right thing to fix this investigation, but believes that Nunes  objectivity is now in question. Graham also says that if he s not willing to share the information he has with his panel colleagues (Republican and Democratic), then he s  lost his ability to lead. At this point, Graham says the Senate is doing a great job with its investigation and suggested that maybe it s time for the Senate to take the reins on this.Watch below:Featured image by Justin Sullivan via Getty Images",News,"March 28, 2017"
 Trump Told Police Union To Report Cops Who Didn’t Vote For Him And It’s Uncomfortable As Hell (VIDEO),"On Tuesday, our resident Manchurian couch potato met with the head of Chicago s Fraternal Order of Police to talk about the  carnage  (as Trump calls it) in the city that prompted Trump to  send in the feds  in January. Sadly, our police are often prevented from doing their jobs,  Trump told union officials at the meeting.  In too many of our communities, violent crime is on the rise. These are painful realities that many in Washington don t want to talk about. We have seen it all over. Trump thanked the union president Dean Angelo for the support he and the union gave during the campaign and, as is custom, took a moment to tell them how much cops love him, describing the numbers in his favor among law enforcement as  extremely lopsided. Then, he said something that would be taken as a joke when uttered by most people   but not by someone who installs people in various government offices to serve as loyalty police: I m just trying to figure out the few people who voted the other way. Who are they? Who are they? Find out who they are, please, and let us know. The room filled with uncertain, muffled, uneasy laughter.Was Trump joking? Who knows? After all, ever since he came to power he has treated the act of firing and threatening anyone who disagrees with him as a regular, everyday activity.Watch this extremely uncomfortable moment below:Featured image via Chicago Tribune",News,"March 28, 2017"
 WATCH: The View HAMMERS Fox News For Ignoring Trump’s Russia Scandal,"As Donald Trump continues to take criticism from the press over his scandalous ties to Russia, the ladies of The View noticed that one network is deafeningly silent.Ever since FBI Director James Comey confirmed that Trump is being investigated for colluding with Russia during the 2016 campaign, the scandal has only widened as House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes demonstrated that he s more interested in derailing the investigation than he is in pursuing it.Nunes has canceled hearings that would have shined more light on Trump s scandal and he also went to the White House to personally inform Trump about the committee s investigation, which is highly unethical and proves that Republicans are incapable of running this investigation.Indeed, Nunes own ties to Russia and Putin have been recently revealed. As it turns out, Nunes owns part of a winery that is connected to a Russian investor who is close to Putin. Furthermore, Nunes served on Trump s transition team. So it s clear that Nunes has a lot to lose if he allows the investigation to move forward.But even though the evidence against Trump is piling up and Republicans have been caught engaging in an attempted cover-up, Fox News is not screaming about it nearly as much as they were screaming about Benghazi.The hosts of View tackled Fox, Trump, and Nunes during their show on Tuesday. And it wasn t pretty either as even the most conservative hosts on the program agreed that something smells awfully fishy.First, Whoopi Goldberg slammed Trump for calling his Russia scandal a  hoax. If it is a hoax, don t you want them to investigate and clear your name, my friend?  she quipped.Joy Behar pointed out that Trump is a  serial liar  so he has zero credibility on this issue. First of all, we know he s a committed serial liar, so when he says it s a hoax, he means it s not a hoax,  she said.Sunny Hostin, who is an attorney, chimed in by attacking Nunes for sneaking off to the White House to inform Trump on what his committee is doing and noted that Nunes could also be in trouble because he may have been caught on a wiretap talking to Russian officials since he was making calls as part of Trump s transition team. Indeed, Nunes  connections to Russia and Putin combined with his unwillingness to run a fair and unbiased investigation should force him to recuse himself and step down from the House Intelligence Committee.Then Whoopi Goldberg and Jedediah Bila teamed up to hammer Fox News. Why isn t Fox screaming about this?  Goldberg asked.  They screamed about Benghazi. She s right. Fox News constantly talked about Benghazi as if it was the scandal to beat all scandals. In the end, it was only a Republican witch hunt against Hillary Clinton and no wrongdoing was found.But Donald Trump has serious connections to Russia and Vladimir Putin and it has been proven that Russia interfered in the 2016 Election on Trump s behalf, especially after Trump asked them to continue hacking our institutions. Several of Trump s aides and closest advisers have been revealed as having significant ties to Putin, including Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, and Carter Page. Even Trump s son-in-law took a meeting with a Russian banker who has close ties to Putin.If you have a brain right now and you re a functioning person, the word  Russia  has come up way too many times with this administration,  Bila pointed out before referencing Putin.  That name is showing up too much for me to be comfortable right now. Here s the video via YouTube:It s time for Congress to let an independent commission take over the investigation from the House Intelligence Committee. Nunes has zero credibility and he has proven that he s nothing but a Trump stooge. A special prosecutor should also be appointed tot eh investigation. Donald Trump s Russia scandal has raged on for months and it s only getting bigger and bigger despite how much Republicans have been dragging their feet. If Hillary Clinton were in the White House right now, Republicans would have triggered investigation after investigation over the tiniest hints of a scandal. But Donald Trump is embroiled in a real scandal that threatens to topple our country to Putin s advantage and Republicans are reluctant to do anything about it because it threatens their power. Not only should Trump be investigated, Republicans in Congress should be investigated for being complicit.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 28, 2017"
 Fox News Host Tells Black Congresswoman To ‘Step Away From Crack Pipe’ (VIDEO),"It would appear Fox News isn t even hiding their blatant racism anymore, nor doing anything about it.Appearing on the cable  news  network, Fox regular Eric Bolling decided he would go all in and call a black Congresswoman a crack addict, and in the worst way possible.While discussing Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), Bolling says, in the most repugnant way possible: You saw what happened to Whitney Houston. Step away from the crack pipe. Step away from the Xanax. Step away from the Lorazepam. It s gonna get you in trouble.

 Trump Gets SKEWERED For Trying To Take Credit For Investment Ford Planned In 2015,"Donald Trump continues to embarrass himself in a desperate effort to prove that he s a job creator.In yet another self-serving and self-promoting post on Twitter, Trump crowed about an announcement made by Ford Motor Company that it is investing $1.2 billion in three automotive plants in Michigan that will keep and create jobs.Big announcement by Ford today. Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants. Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017However, Ford previously planned this investment back in 2015 while President Obama was still in office.According to The Detroit News,The company said Tuesday it will invest $850 million to retool its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne for truck and SUV production; $150 million in its Romeo Engine Plant to expand capacity for several vehicles; and $200 million to build a data center at the company s Flat Rock Assembly Plant. The investments at the Michigan Assembly Plant and Romeo Engine Plant were negotiated as part of the 2015 Ford-United Auto Workers contract. The investments at Flat Rock   those announced today and those announced in January   are new.In short, most of the investments Trump is praising were already going to happen as part of deal between Ford executives and the labor union, which means a labor should get the credit for helping American workers and preventing jobs from being outsourced to other countries. Trump had nothing to do with it.This isn t the first time Trump has taken credit for investments and job growth companies planned prior to him taking office.Trump also took credit for a Charter Communications announcement to create 20,000 jobs even though that plan was also made in 2015.Of course, while Trump supporters are gullible enough to believe he is responsible for these job gains, everyone else is not buying it. Twitter users made that clear in their comments.Hey @realDonaldTrump, these are all part of the 2015 Ford-United Auto Workers contract. Had nothing to do with you https://t.co/TMzR8doV76  Josh S nchez (@jnsanchez) March 28, 2017@realDonaldTrump Every time you make these announcements, we later find out that the deal had been in place months.Sign of desperation.

 Undocumented Immigrant Dares Trump To Release His Taxes After Proving She Pays Hers,"Donald Trump s head is going to explode when he sees this.Back in September as the 2016 campaign raged on, Trump claimed that undocumented immigrants cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars and complained that only 5 percent to 10 percent of them pay taxes. Illegal immigration, each year, costs us between $200 billion and $300 billion,  Trump told CNN host Erin Burnett.  I don t know if anybody gives you those numbers. Probably not. There s very little, percentage-wise,  Trump said on the number of immigrants who pay taxes.  There s very little, probably 5 percent, 10 percent. Wrong.As it turns out, Trump claimed in August that the figure was around $113 billion. But Politifact rated his claim  false  after doing some research. Trump s information comes from an unreliable conservative think tank that fiercely opposes immigration. Reports from other organizations, even conservative ones, put the figure drastically lower.It also turns out that around more than half of the undocumented immigrants in this country pay more taxes than Donald Trump does. After all, just a single year of Trump s tax returns showed that he probably didn t pay a dime in federal income taxes for over a decade. Undocumented immigrants on the other hand, have contributed $12 billion to Social Security alone as well as other federal, local and state taxes, while not being able to receive any federal, state, or local benefits.That may be a huge reason why Trump refuses to release his tax returns. Because he knows that they would expose him as the hypocrite, liar, and tax cheat that he is.Now one undocumented immigrant is bravely daring Trump to release his taxes after she proved his claims wrong with a single photograph.Belen Sisa is a resident of Arizona who was brought to America by her undocumented immigrant parents when she was six years old. Sisa decided to send a message to Donald Trump and all of those anti-immigrant conservatives who believe the myths about undocumented immigrants that right-wing groups constantly spew.So she posted a picture of herself proudly holding up her tax returns on Facebook and included the following message:I, an undocumented immigrant, just filed my taxes and PAID $300 to the state of Arizona. I cannot receive financial aid from the state or federal government for school, I cannot benefit from unemployment, a reduced healthcare plan, or a retirement fund. I think I m a pretty good citizen. Oh and there are MILLIONS just like me who pay into a system they will never receive anything from. Wanna tell me again how I should be deported, contribute nothing and only leech off this country while the 1% wealthiest people in this country steal from you everyday? How about you show me yours Donald J. Trump? #HereToStay Your move, Donald.Featured Image: Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"March 28, 2017"
 The Internet Drags Trump’s Son For Saying ‘There’s No Better Patriot In The World Than Sean Hannity’,"In the wake of Tom Koppel telling Sean Hannity to his face that he is bad for America, Eric Trump came to the Fox  News  host s rescue. Eric Trump, who has never served in the military just like his father and Sean Hannity, declared on Fox and Friends that  there is no better patriot in the world than Sean Hannity.  adding,  I think he s just a great, great man. He said that beliefs are what  get America to a great place. He has strong beliefs,  Eric Trump said.  And you know, beliefs are what get America to a great place, beliefs on quite frankly, both sides of the aisle.

He lives a lavish lifestyle, owning several homes, each worth millions. But yeah, Hannity is more of a  patriot  than a man or woman who puts their lives on the line to protect our country   and for very little pay. Eric Trump is a trophy hunter and he probably thinks he s a brave patriot, too.The two have much in common. Both of them will justify anything alleged president Donald Trump does, even if he marched into a high school and opened fire.In response to his interview with Mr. Koppel, Hannity tweeted that it was  fake edited news,  because of course he did.Hannity is no patriot. Those that served in the military must be cringing right now. Donald Trump s son just threw them under the bus for a wealthy Fox News host who has been sucking up to the amateur president on his show while calling liberals  snowflakes.

 CNN Guest’s Face After Trump Flack Blatantly Lies About Obama Golfing Is All Of Us Right Now (VIDEO),"It s Trump s third month in office and the lies about President Obama just keep coming.During a CNN panel to discuss Trump s 13th golf vacation, long-time Trump flack and woman without shame Kayleigh McEnany, thought she would help her president out by spinning a blatant lie about Obama. Trump should be excused from criticism for his repeated golf trips, McEnany reasoned, because Obama once golfed shortly after a journalist named Daniel Pearl was murdered by extremists in Pakistan.As anyone not currently trying to exploit his death to protect Trump might know, Pearl was murdered in 2002. Obama wouldn t become president for six years. And there is no evidence that he was golfing   as a then state senator   at the time. McEnany just flat-out lied.WATCH: Kayleigh McEnany: Obama rushed off to golf after Daniel Pearl was beheaded.Pearl was killed in 2002. Obama was a state senator. pic.twitter.com/5QkFRgjoR4  Yashar (@yashar) March 28, 2017Next to her was Atlantic writer Peter Beinart whose stunned expression pretty much sums it up.Beinart is used to this level of idiocy from Trump surrogates.

For years, Trump attacked the former president for taking vacations or playing golf while he was in office. During the campaign, Trump vowed to never take a vacation and promised he would have no time for golf. Since being elected, that s gone out the window. He s now spent nearly every weekend in his first two months playing golf at courses he owns.Adding further absurdity to McEnany s defense of Trump, the president doesn t let national mourning stop his golf game. He played golf this weekend during the same time a white supremacist terrorist was charged with murdering a random black man as  practice  before a planned mass murder of black people in New York City. Trump has refused to comment on the incident. He visited his Virginia golf course twice, lying about what he was doing both times.Featured image via Twitter",News,"March 28, 2017"

While she doesn t mind exploiting a little nepotism to get her own office in the White House, she actively pretends she s innocent in all of this.Part of her strategy is to promote herself (and her brand) on social media as family-friendly and fun.

Trump has shown no interest in murdering elephants individually, but his lack of respect for environmental protections might make him one of their greatest enemies nonetheless. Trump recently proposed defunding every cent of federal funding to combat climate change. Every single cent. His new head of the EPA, a climate science denier, called fighting the devastating effects of climate change a  waste of time. Renowned climate scientist Michael Mann put what Trump is doing in the simplest possible terms: It s an all-out assault on Earth. Meanwhile, African elephants continue to slowly circle towards extinction. Plagued by a changing environment, poachers, and human development, their habitat has become a dangerous place to live.

 Sean Spicer Just Said Something About Trumpcare That Will Make Trump PISSED (DETAILS),"When Donald Trump fails, his team sure doesn t help make it any better.On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer decided to pour salt in the gaping wound that was left when Trump and the GOP suffered a massive failure in gaining approval for their disastrous plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. The American Health Care Act, also known as Trumpcare, not only failed to get enough votes, but Trump pulled it from the House floor because it was such an obvious, humiliating defeat.In speaking to reporters during his daily briefing, Spicer likened Trumpcare to a  bad deal    which was a pretty odd thing to say, considering how much Trump has bragged about what a good negotiator and dealmaker he is. To diss something that Trump supported full-heartedly is definitely not going to make Trump happy. Spicer said: The president also recognizes that when there s not a deal to be made, when to walk away. It s not just about making deals. It s knowing when to walk away from deals and knowing [that] when there s a bad deal, that s the only solution. I think the president understood that where we were, that while you can get a deal at the time, that sometimes a bad deal is worse than getting a deal. And I think he smartly recognized that what was on the table was not going to be keeping with the vision that he had, and so he decided that this was not the time and that a deal was not at hand. Really, who needs critics when you have Spicer? It should also be noted that even after the bill failed, Trump was still praising the GOP s awful plan, stating that it just needed some improvement. Yet Spicer pretty much trashed Trumpcare, and said that the GOP s plan to do away with Obamacare (which they ve been bragging about for the last seven years) was a devastating fail. Looks like Trump really doesn t have a talent for making deals after all.Featured image via Ninian Reid / Flickr",News,"March 27, 2017"
 Trump’s ‘Deportation Force’ Storms Unarmed Legal Resident’s Home And Shoots Him,"A Chicago man is in critical condition after the mother of all epic f*ckups by Trump s  Deportation Force.  On Monday morning, ICE agents raided the home of Felix Torres. It is unclear why they would choose to raid the home   not a single person inside is undocumented   but apparently, we are not too concerned about accuracy when we kick down brownish people s doors in Trump s America.At approximately 6:00 a.m., immigration agents entered the home, refusing to tell any of the residents why they were there. According to officials, Torres pulled a gun on the armed men who had forced their way into his home and refused to explain their presence   Torres  family says that s utter hogwash. They didn t say anything. They just came in and pointed pistols in our faces and dragged us out,  Torres  daughter Carmen says, noting that she was not even allowed to dress or grab milk for her one-year-old daughter, who was sleeping when the armed men invaded the home.  It s a lie when they say he was holding a gun. He doesn t even own a gun,  she said.  They shot my dad. They shot him, and I don t know why. At least eight family members were in the house at the time, including numerous children. According to Carmen Torres, the family has lived there for  at least 30 years. We re going to have to talk to CPD to find out if this was a coordinated effort, because if it was in any way, that raises concerns about us as a sanctuary city,  36th Ward Alderman Gilbert Villegas said of the attack.  Is this our future in Chicago with Donald Trump as president? The community s got to be nervous about this, and rightfully so, because you have a right to be in your own home without being intimidated,  Villegas says.  I m conflicted because I haven t got all the details [of the incident] yet, but from the way this has started to play out, it looks like an overstep by an overzealous ICE agent who s just trying to follow Trump s orders. ICE officials say they were not at the home to arrest Torres, though they will nor provide further details. The victim was taken to a nearby hospital where his condition is listed as critical. The shooting is being investigated, though we probably can not expect much in terms of a reasonable resolution to the situation.Featured image via Facebook",News,"March 27, 2017"
 Even Dick Cheney Is Making The Case For Why There Needs To Be A New Election,"In a more innocent time, say, 2015, you d be hard pressed to find a person willing to call Dick Cheney a voice of reason, (except perhaps, when talking about his daughter s right to marry the woman she loves), but in a speech at the Economic Times  Global Business Summit, he appeared to be just that, only in his very neo-con way. Cheney called Russia s meddling in the 2016 election an  act of war. There s no question that there was a very serious effort made by Mr. Putin and his government, his organization, to interfere in major ways with our basic fundamental democratic processes,  said Cheney.  In some quarters that could be considered an act of war. I would not underestimate the weight that we as Americans assign to Russian attempts to interfere with our process,  said Cheney, finishing the thought.Source: Business InsiderFeeling a little conflicted? Who can blame you. For nearly 20 years, Dick Cheney has been itching to go to war with nearly anyone he can find. On the other hand, he s right. There is no more blatant an act of war than interference with our election. Even Cheney is saying that Trump is likely an illegitimate president, and this is a man who only held his office as Vice President because the Supreme Court overturned the will of the people.Of course, the problem with that is that the Constitution has no mechanism for dealing with another country stealing our election. We can, however, impeach, which might not put us in a much better position. Could Donald Trump s election be nullified by some legal process, if it was found that either the Russian interference could be deemed decisive in accomplishing Trump s victory, or that Trump and his team have somehow contravened the U.S. public interest through a treasonous relationship with the Russians? Article II of the United States Constitution states in Section 4 that  The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors. Source: Midas LetterThis, apparently, is exactly where we are. While the smoking gun might still be classified, it s becoming increasingly apparent that there is a smoking gun there are several smoking guns, all covered with the fingerprints of Trump and his associates.While this might be just another case of Cheney banging the war drums, he s still right. Russian interference was an act of war and while it shouldn t be addressed with bombs and boots on the ground, it should be addressed.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"March 27, 2017"
 Nunes ADMITS He Was Secretly At WH Right Before He Magically Found Source ‘Vindicating’ Trump,"If there is one upside to having this level of unchecked corruption running through the Trump White House it s that they aren t very good at hiding it.In yet another example of the lengths Trump s cronies will go to cover for him, the Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, was just exposed as having been secretly at the White House the night before he magically  discovered  an unnamed source that seemingly vindicated parts of Donald Trump s wiretapping claims. Nunes claims that this visit was harmless and wasn t about coordinating with Trump. And Nunes thinks you are stupid enough to believe that.Speaking to Eli Lake at Bloomberg, Nunes feigned innocence:In an interview Monday, Nunes told me that he ended up meeting his source on the White House grounds because it was the most convenient secure location with a computer connected to the system that included the reports, which are only distributed within the executive branch.  We don t have networked access to these kinds of reports in Congress,  Nunes said. He added that his source was not a White House staffer and was an intelligence official.But Daily Beast reporter Tim Mak   who recently broke the story that Nunes had disappeared the night before his  bombshell  came out   noted how ridiculous the premise was. Of course the House Intelligence Chairman has access to secure locations in the Capitol. He s the House Intelligence Committee Chairman. His whole job is working with sensitive information in a secure way.Just a reminder that the committee Nunes chairs has its own secure area, and he could have easily used that https://t.co/Z7E0cwkicl  Tim Mak (@timkmak) March 27, 2017Nunes was one of Trump s biggest supporters during the election. As head of the intelligence committee, he has repeatedly claimed that he is impartial enough to investigate Trump, but this latest exposure of malpractice might be the straw that breaks the camel s back. Nunes seems incapable of doing a single thing that doesn t point to his coordination with Donald Trump. Rather than investigate Trump, Nunes seems hellbent on providing cover for him.As if to reinforce that point, Nunes has yet to provide a shred of evidence to back up his claims that Trump was wrongfully surveilled. Ironically, the only thing he has done is bring up the possibility that Trump was incidentally recorded in FBI wiretaps of known criminals. He might want to avoid bringing that up the next time he secretly goes to the White House.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"March 27, 2017"
" WATCH: After Facing Angry Constituents At Town Hall, GOP Rep Runs Out The Back Door","Just one day after Paul Ryan failed to garner support from his own base to repeal and replace Obamacare, a proposal alleged president Donald Trump staunchly supported, Rep. John Culberson (R-TX) had to face hundreds of angry constituents at a town hall in Texas on Saturday. Let s just say that he didn t have a good weekend.We ll give Culberson credit for at least showing up while many of his colleagues refuse to face their own constituents. There were claims that the angry constituents were paid protesters, but, to gain entry into the auditorium attendees had to prove their residency by showing either a photo I.D. with a current address or a photo I.D. with a current utility bill.Constituents packed into a Houston middle school auditorium that was filled to a capacity of 700 with many remaining outside. About 500 people remained in a line outside, shouting,  Let us in! Let us in!Culberson had to face questions about Donald Trump and the Republicans  agenda on health care. You know what, folks? I m either going to answer the question, or we re just going to spend the time yelling,  Culberson told his crowd of constituents, according to the Houston Chronicle.The Texas congressman told his constituents that even though Republicans failed to pass Trumpcare, he was still committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare. That, too, didn t go down well. The only way to fix it is to replace it,  he said while his constituents chanted,  Fix it,  the Texas Tribune reports.When asked about the amateur president s proposal to cut the State Department, Culberson said he did not support the cuts while the crowd chanted,  Yes or no. I just answered,  he responded.  The answer is no.   I ll work hard to protect the Department of State. Culberson was pretty much booed the entire time:He also said he would support funding for the National Institutes for Health and the National Endowment for the Arts, per the Texas Tribune. He told the crowd that he would support funding for public broadcasting in the short term, but that those programs should  ultimately  be self-supporting, which was met with boos from the crowd, according to the Houston Chronicle.Here s the video:As a shock to no one ever, Culberson said it is  up to the President  whether he releases his tax returns.Then, instead of taking questions from constituents who waited for an hour and a half outside and reporters who were behind him, Culberson quickly left through the back door after the town hall. Funny thing, when you try to take away healthcare from millions of Americans, they get mad.Image via screen capture. ",News,"March 27, 2017"
 Obama’s Press Secretary Just Got A New Job; Trump’s Going To HATE It (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is soon going to be unleashing even more  fake news  attacks on the media than ever before.It turns out that former President Barack Obama s Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, just got a new job   and it s definitely going to piss the entire Trump administration off. While most Americans miss seeing Earnest s press briefings   especially because he s been replaced by pathetic Sean Spicer   we will now be able to see him speak regularly as a political contributor for NBC News and MSNBC!NBC News President Noah Oppenheim and MSNBC President Phil Griffin made this announcement on Monday, and it s clear that they couldn t be happier with Earnest joining the team, considering his extensive political experience under Obama. The memo they circulated this morning said: We are pleased to announce that Josh Earnest will join NBC News and MSNBC as a Political Analyst. As you may have seen, he made his debut this morning on  Today  and  Morning Joe. Josh recently completed a ten-year run with President Obama, most recently serving as White House Press Secretary from 2014-2017.Josh joined the Obama presidential campaign in March 2007 as the Iowa communications director, and went on to serve as deputy communications director during the 2008 general election. Josh has also worked on numerous national, statewide and local campaigns over the course of his twenty years in politics. As expected, Earnest s debut was nothing but epic, and it s just what we would expect from the former Press Secretary after working closely with Obama for so many years. Earnest marked his first day in his new role in NBC s Today, where he didn t hesitate to talk about what a massive failure Trump was and how pathetic the GOP s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare was.You can watch Earnest s debut here:Featured image via Gage Skidmore / Flickr",News,"March 27, 2017"
 Paul Ryan Was So Desperate To Pass Failed Trumpcare Bill That He Got On His Knees To Beg For Votes,"This is what being pathetic looks like.House Speaker Paul Ryan was so desperate to secure Republican votes for his disastrous healthcare bill that he literally got down on his knees to beg one lawmaker for his support.As we all know, the floor vote was canceled on Thursday after it became clear that not enough Republicans were willing to support the bill.Donald Trump even met with and threatened Republicans with consequences if they didn t fall in line. But the meeting backfired as even more Republicans leaned against the bill after hearing Trump speak.The cancellation of Thursday s vote infuriated Trump, who proceeded to demand a vote on Friday and Republican leaders reluctantly caved.And so, Paul Ryan spent time fruitlessly begging his Republican colleagues to throw their support behind a bad bill that would have stripped healthcare from over 20 million Americans and caused the cost of healthcare premiums to skyrocket.One lawmaker Ryan approached was Alaska Rep. Don Young.According to the Washington Post, Ryan actually got down on one knee to beg Young to endorse the bill.Leaders continued to plead with individual lawmakers to support the measure well into Thursday night, with the House Rules Committee slated to meet early Friday morning to consider the proposed changes.Ryan got down on a knee to plead with Rep. Don Young, an 83-year-old from Alaska who is the longest-serving Republican in Congress and remains undecided.But Young ignored Ryan desperate plea and remained in opposition and even praised the cancellation of Friday s vote a  victory for Alaska. My job is to represent those people in that state, and I think we did this this week,  Young told Alaska Dispatch News.  I work with (House Speaker Paul Ryan), don t get me wrong   the speaker talked to me quite a bit. But it didn t come to a point where I could support this bill. He needed my vote. Yeah, he needed it so much that he begged for it on bended knee. Sad!Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"March 27, 2017"
 Dan Rather: Trump’s First Two Months In Office Is Worst Start He’s Ever Seen,"Legendary newsman Dan Rather has lived through and covered several presidencies so he knows what he s talking about.Rather was just a boy of 13 when Franklin D. Roosevelt died in 1945. In 1950, he began his career in journalism while Harry Truman was in office.Since then, Rather has witnessed every presidential beginning and has even reported on them.And according to Rather, Donald Trump s first two months in the presidency are the worst he has ever seen.Rather posted his observation on Facebook early Monday morning, even going so far as to quip that the only president who had a worse start was William Henry Harrison, who died one month after being sworn in.We re roughly two months into the Trump Presidency, and it is the worst start to a time in office I have ever seen. I am not alone in this conclusion. Many Presidential scholars are saying it s the worst start of any Presidency in the history of the country.Now William Henry Harrison in 1841 talked too long in the cold of his inauguration. He caught pneumonia and died a month later. So, yes, I suppose you could say that his time was worse.One of those Presidential scholars is Douglas Brinkley, who said that that Trump s administration is so bad that treason is hanging over it. This is the most failed first 100 days of any president,  Brinkley concluded.Rather then briefly listed some of Trump s failures.So after two tumultuous, chaotic and in many ways outrageous months (an embarrassing defeat on ACA repeal, the deepening Russia probe, the striking down of the travel ban) where do we stand? Where does all of this go?Rather went on to warn the American people that  a weak President running a weak, ragtag administration is a prescription for trouble. Trouble internationally could come from enemies and other competitors who may see opportunities for advantage and overreach. Trouble internally could easily come from a worried, divided nation, and opportunistic ideologues and politicians who try to exploit the situation.Rather concluded by urging people to remain vigilant and continue fighting.Donald Trump and his entire administration is a bad joke. He has turned our nation into a laughingstock around the world and has repeatedly demonstrated that he is incompetent.Trump should resign before he embarrasses our country and himself even further.Featured Image: Matthew Eisman/Getty Images",News,"March 27, 2017"
 BREAKING: Devin Nunes Is Now The Subject Of A CRIMINAL Complaint To The FBI,"Embattled House Intel Chairman, Devin Nunes (R-CA), has been reported to the FBI for corruption. The criminal complaint, filed by Scott Dworkin of the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, seems to include Nunes  failure to disclose the fact that he s got all his money sunk into a winery with heavy ties to Russia (which means he s got a conflict of interest). It may also includ his admission that he had an obligation to inform Trump that some of his transition team s communications got swept up in a foreign surveillance operation.Nunes is definitely compromised, which is worth investigating.Dworkin can t make the details of his complaint public, but he did say that Nunes is unethical and that he was working on just such a complaint earlier today:RT if u think Devin Nunes is unethicalI doI m finishing our House Ethics Complaint on him now#NunesMustResign #trumprussia #russiagate  Scott Dworkin (@funder) March 26, 2017Then he tweeted the news that his criminal complaint had officially been filed, along with the FBI s explanation of their public corruption program.

 California Governor Delivers HARSH Message To Donald Trump; He’s Messing With The Wrong State (VIDEO),"It s no secret that Californians aren t really fans of Donald Trump and Trump can t stand California. California rejected Trump during the election by a whopping 30 percent margin. In turn, Trump has called the most populous state in the union,  out of control,  and threatened to withhold money if they don t bend to Trump s will. California s governor, Jerry Brown, on Meet the Press on Sunday, said Trump would be picking a fight with the wrong governor.At specific issue is that fact that many of California s cities are sanctuary cities, which means it s safe for undocumented residents to report crimes without fear of deportation. Now, anyone with half a brain knows that people reporting crimes is one of the biggest weapons against criminals, but Trump tells his supporters that sanctuary cities are hotbeds of danger. They aren t. In fact because people can report crime, they are typically safer.California is not backing down to Trump s bullying. If he pulls funding from California, California is going to retaliate and that s the last thing Trump wants. We do have something called the ninth and the tenth amendment,  he stated.  The federal government just can t arbitrarily for political reasons punish the State of California, that s number one. Number two, California is America. We re 12 percent. We re a key part. The export capital going into the Pacific. We re the innovation capital, high tech, agriculture, 40 to 50 billion dollar industry. You don t want to mess with California because you re going to mess with the economy, and that could blow up in your face in a gigantic recession, and roll the Republicans right out of this town. Source: NBC NewsHere s the video: Brown isn t just talking out his you-know-what. Without California, the country is in a whole lot of hurt. Not only is it the largest state, it s also the 6th largest economy in the world. Its economy surpasses France and India. Or, if Trump voters need to see something a bit more tangible, let s just say that without California, the cost of food (if you can find it) will go through the roof.California produces a sizable majority of many American fruits, vegetables, and nuts: 99 percent of artichokes, 99 percent of walnuts, 97 percent of kiwis, 97 percent of plums, 95 percent of celery, 95 percent of garlic, 89 percent of cauliflower, 71 percent of spinach, and 69 percent of carrots (and the list goes on and on).Without California, supply of all these products in the United States and abroad would dip, and in the first few years, a few might be nearly impossible to find. Orchard-based products in particular, such as nuts and some fruits, would take many years to spring back.Price surges would eventually become the larger issue. Rising prices would force Americans to consume more grains, which are locked in a complicated price-dependent relationship with fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats. When the price of produce increases, people eat more grain. When the price of grain drops, people eat more fruits and vegetables. (In fact, in some parts of the world, wheat and rice are the only proven  Giffen goods a product in which decreasing prices lead to decreasing demand.) Young people and the poor in America, more than others, eat less fresh food when prices rise.Source: SlateBeyond that, though, could you imagine, if just once, President Obama threatened to pull funding from, let s say, Texas   a state which was consistently hostile to the Democratic President. Republicans and many Democrats would have had a fit and they would have been right. Donald Trump works for us, all of us, not just the people who voted for him. It s time he learn that and Jerry Brown is the perfect person to teach the lesson.Featured image via video screen capture. ",News,"March 26, 2017"
 The Internet Goes For Newt Gingrich’s Throat Over Old Tweet About Obama Golfing,"Donald Trump repeatedly attacked former President Barack Obama each time he went golfing but the alleged billionaire has just taken his 13th golfing trip in the two months he s been on the job.

My company is in great shape. @BarackObama plays golf to escape work while America goes down the drain. Meanwhile, Trump broke another campaign promise, this one to repeal and replace Obamacare. Instead, he offered tax breaks for the wealthy while throwing the elderly, veterans and lower-income Americans under the bus. Then he went golfing after his plan failed miserably.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images with added tweet. ",News,"March 26, 2017"
" Trump Insulted German Leader On First Visit, Gave Her A ‘Bill’ For NATO (DETAILS)","The fact that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is no fan of Donald Trump is no secret. However, being the diplomatic, experienced world leader that she is, Chancellor Merkel took the time she was forced to spend at the White House with Trump in stride. She smiled at the cameras at all the right times, held a joint presser with him, and was cordial to all, as real world leaders do. This all comes as Trump insulted Merkel more than once during the visit. We all know that he infamously embarrassed our nation by petulantly refusing to shake the Chancellor s hand, and now, there is a new report out that Trump actually gave Merkel an  invoice  for expenses that he believes Germany owes for defenses provided by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).According to The Hill via a report from The Times of London, Trump s insane bill  charges  Merkel roughly 300 billion pounds. A response from a German minister on Trump s childish stunt was predictably and deservedly scathing, essentially saying that Merkel has no intentions of stooping to Trump s level: The concept behind putting out such demands is to intimidate the other side, but the chancellor took it calmly and will not respond to such provocations. The same minister said that Merkel, quote,  ignored the provocations.  Of course, the White House says that Trump never gave Merkel the invoice, but that s likely just another lie to cover up for Trump s petulant, childish, and internationally embarrassing behavior.In fact, it is perfectly plausible that Trump gave Merkel this  invoice,  because he had already had aides calculate just how much below 2 percent of Germany s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was spent on NATO defense in the last 12 years. Countries within NATO all commit to spending 2 percent of their GDP annually to support NATO. Trump even had the people doing the calculations add interest.This is just beyond embarrassing. Here is another ally we are on the rocks with, all because we have a president who acts like a whiny school yard bully instead of leader of the free world.Featured image Cheriss May/NurPhoto via Getty Images",News,"March 26, 2017"
 Hannity Just Fired Off An ABSURD Tweet At CBS For Koppel Interview – Twitter SHREDS Him For It,"Sean Hannity is pissed. Really pissed. Earlier today, he appeared on CBS   Sunday Morning  for an interview with veteran ABC News anchor Ted Koppel, which didn t go well for him. In that interview, Hannity did his level best to keep Koppel from making his point (meaning he was interrupting Koppel every chance he got), but Koppel wasn t having it. He literally said that he thinks Hannity and his ilk are  bad for America,  and dropped the hammer on why: You have attracted people who are determined that ideology is more important than fact. That s the truth, and Hannity doesn t like it. In a way, he s like Trump   he s not wrong, everyone else is wrong. Whether or not he agrees with something is what determines whether it is a fact. So, like his idol, President Cheeto McTinyhands, he took to Twitter to blast CBS for editing the interview the way they did: Fake Edited News  @CBSNews release the Unedited 45 minute interview so people can see the BS games you play in the edit room. I dare you! https://t.co/prynzE2yLQ  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 26, 2017 Fake Edited News,  and then a demand that they air the entire 45-minute interview is classic Donald Trump. But what can we expect? It s been obvious for a long time that he s in love with Trump. Now he s even copying him, so when can we expect Hannity to start stalking him?More to the point, though, as someone who himself conducts on-air interviews that have time constraints on them, Hannity is acting extremely hypocritically here. He also just made himself look incredibly dumb   both things with which Twitter is having a field day:@seanhannity Has your show ever edited an interview or cut one short due to time constraints?Or are you just a massive hypocrite? @CBSNews  Steven Buckley (@StevenJCBuckley) March 26, 2017@seanhannity @CBSNews look at you using daddy s  quote  marks.

 Watch Legendary Reporter Ted Koppel Tell Hannity Right To His Face He’s Bad For America (VIDEO),"With the cool, calm authority that comes with decades of being one of the most well-respected newsman in journalism, Ted Koppel flat-out told Sean Hannity that he and his show are destroying America from within. He did it right to Sean Hannity s face. And he didn t even hesitate.In what is perhaps one of the best moments of television in 2017, Koppel sat down with Hannity to discuss journalism and politics during a broadcast of CBS Sunday Morning. Hannity, who has spent the last year or so working as a de facto propagandist for Donald Trump from his chair at Fox News, was clearly not ready for the truthbombs Koppel was about to drop. Hannity s expression goes from amusement to surprise to anger to genuine fear as Koppel laid out why the Fox host is awful.HANNITY: Do you think I m bad for America? KOPPEL: Yeah. HANNITY: You do? KOPPEL (nodding): In the long-haul, I think you and all these opinion shows [are].Hannity starts to interrupt Koppel at several times. Koppel calmly regains control of the interview and continues with this brutal reminder: You have attracted people who are determined that ideology is more important than fact. He s not exaggerating. Fox News viewers have been repeatedly shown to be among the least informed people in the country. A 2014 analysis of Fox News found that over half of all statements said on the network were  false. Hannity, in particular, ranks among the worst propagator of  fake news  in the country. Politifact observed that Hannity lies at least half of the times they checked him. And Trump has actually made Hannity worse.Somewhere around election day something in Hannity s brain finally snapped. Always a right-wing flack, Hannity has taken it upon himself to be Trump s most blindly loyal cheerleader. There is quite possibly no act too depraved for Trump to commit that would make Hannity criticize it. His blatant sycophancy is widely seen as the least subtle on Fox.It s easy to see why a man like that covering for relentless liar Donald Trump is really, really bad for America.Featured image via Twitter / h/t @yashar",News,"March 26, 2017"
 Someone Just Showed What Trump Was Doing At His Golf Club While He Said He Was In ‘Meetings’ (PHOTO),"One day after Trump had his 12th golfing trip as president he returned to his golf club in Virginia for lucky number 13.Like yesterday, Trump told pool reporters he was at serious  meetings.  He spent just 55 minutes at the golf resort he owns. How did he attend so many serious meetings in so little time? Easy. He didn t.And his lie quickly unraveled.During the time in which he was said to be in meetings, an Instagram user posted a picture of Trump sitting in a deserted dining room  watching the Golf Channel.Someone just posted this on Instagram from Trump's golf club. POTUS appears to be watching Golf Channel with 2 other people. pic.twitter.com/5LpVRHR1Do  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) March 26, 2017So even when he s not actually golfing, Trump is watching other people golf. What he isn t doing is actually running the country. Each of his trips costs anywhere between hundreds of thousand and millions of dollars.Making matters worse, it s been just two days since Trump failed to deliver on his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. The bill he and Paul Ryan proposed was so incredibly awful that it failed to even reach a House vote (despite Republicans having an overwhelming majority of seats). The next day he flew to his Virginia golf course where he   you guessed it   got caught golfing.Pool was told Trump was in meetings at Trump National this afternoon. This Instagram photo posted from the course says otherwise pic.twitter.com/WMudqofGmO  Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) March 25, 2017Trump is extremely bad at lying about what he is doing. Apparently the notion that people at his golf clubs might take pictures proving he s doing the thing he promised he would never do as president never occurred to Trump. He remains either oblivious or willfully defiant of the critics.Unreal.Featured image via Twitter",News,"March 26, 2017"
 Trump Accidentally Makes Democrats Look Great During Angry Tirade About His Failed Healthcare Bill,"Less than 24 hours after Trump claimed he would be exclusively blaming Democrats for not endorsing his bill to uninsure 24 million people, he was lashing out at Republicans instead. He just couldn t help himself.The meltdown began last night as Trump used his Twitter account to promote Fox News  Jeanine Pirro s Saturday night show. When people tuned in, they saw Pirro go on a vicious assault against Paul Ryan, demanding he step down as Speaker of the House. Trump, apparently too much of a coward to say it himself, wants you to know how much he hates Paul Ryan.The next morning, his temper had only gotten worse. Not leaving it to Paul Ryan, Trump lashed out at conservative Republicans for not properly supporting the bill.Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2017The tweet was particularly awkward because it was disturbingly true  Yes, Democrats are smiling following the disastrous Trumpcare misfire. Things like Planned Parenthood and Obamacare provide life-saving resources to tens of millions of people. Preserving those things is something worth smiling about. The fact that Trump and Paul Ryan humiliated themselves in the process only makes those smiles a little broader.MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnell observed:I'm smiling at you attacking the people you need on your next vote. Please keep doing this. Please! https://t.co/5deg1puxyU  Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) March 26, 2017Trump s latest meltdown   directed exclusively at Republicans   signals the sheer chaos that s rippling through the GOP following their healthcare fail. The implosion was so spectacular that nobody seems to be able to agree on a coherent message. Trump, for his part, has oscillated between  I m not mad!  and spittle-laden fury. He may have even found a scapegoat  Reince Priebus.Source close to @POTUS says he's being advised to replace @Reince45 & is open to possibility   healthcare was last straw  Tara Palmeri (@tarapalmeri) March 25, 2017But if anyone is squarely to blame for the GOP s failure to repeal and replace Obamacare it s Trump himself, who spent a truly embarrassing lack of time on trying to accomplish it. Here s a typical write-up of Trump s involvement in the legislative process:Despite the proclamations of Paul Ryan, Sean Spicer, and others to spin Trump s participation in the AHCA push as some impressive feat of presidential prowess, several reports indicate that Trump was mostly disengaged from the process, divided over its merits, and only involved himself at the last minute, largely out of ego.The perception among lawmakers and White House insiders was that Trump was never personally invested in the bill, repeatedly asking aides if they thought it was good or not, typically prompted by the consistently negative media coverage of the bill that Trump was watching, according to the Washington Post.Many people, some even close to the president, admitted that they didn t believe Trump actually knew what was in the bill.The fact that he s now using his own shoddy leadership as a pretext to go to war with his own political party is music to any liberal s ears. This is a man whose ego is so large that he would rather burn every bridge he has than accept the fact that he botched the rollout of a complicated bill through incompetence and indifference. Instead he s incoherently lashing out at anyone he can think of: Democrats, Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, the entire Republican Party.What a piece of work.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"March 26, 2017"
 Kremlin Threatens Trump: Stop Leaking Like A Colander Or We’ll Release Info," Snitches get stitches  is Kremlin s message to the United States   at least according to Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, anyway. Discussing Rex Tillerson s planned visit to Russia, Zakharova complained about the leaks coming out of the Trump administration:First, the US Department of State asked us to keep the planned visit quiet and not to announce it until the last possible minute, until we coordinated the date. We did as they asked. But a day or two later the information was leaked by the US State Department and sometimes by the US administration. Frankly, this put Russia and the media in a strange situation, because they didn t know who to believe   the official agencies or the many leaks.If the Trump administration continues leaking like a colander, she says, there will be consequences:Also, I would like to say that if the practice of leaking information that concerns not just the United States but also Russia, which has become a tradition in Washington in the past few years, continues, there will come a day when the media will publish leaks about the things that Washington asked us to keep secret, for example, things that happened during President Obama s terms in office. Believe me, this could be very interesting information.Recently, Trump has been in a panic trying to contain leaks   particularly about his and his administration s relationship with Russia.At this point, it is fair to ask: what do they have on him and other Republicans? Is this threat to release Obama-era information a veiled warning to The Donald to plug the holes through which facts are slipping?Featured image via Getty Images (Mikhail Svetlov/Pool)",News,"March 26, 2017"
" Republicans Turn On Trump, Throw Him Under The Bus For F*cking Up Health Care Plan (DETAILS)","When Republicans celebrated Donald Trump s undeserved election victory, they probably never imagined he d damage the party as badly as he already has in just nine weeks.This week, Trump once again embarrassed the GOP by messing up their first attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare. Not only did Trump fail to sell the disastrous American Health Care Act, but he pulled the bill on Friday. Understandably, Republicans are pissed that Trump conducted things this way, and are distancing themselves from him more than ever. In fact, they re blaming him and saying that he and the White House had been an obstacle from the start, setting them up for failure. One House Republican (who wanted to remain anonymous) said: Their heart was not in the healthcare battle. Think about the level of intensity on the executive orders for the travel ban, or on the wiretapping claims. He certainly checked the boxes on healthcare, to his credit. But it s self-evident there was not a certain level of intensity devoted to this. Trump and his minions have countered this claim, with Press Secretary Sean Spicer issuing a statement on Saturday: The president and vice president left everything on the field  They were making calls and having members to the White House all week. In total, we spoke or met with over 120 members of Congress. And yet, this doesn t seem to add up, considering that Trump s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were nowhere to be found as sh*t was hitting the fan on Friday. Kushner, who is one of Trump s key advisors, was actually skiing with Ivanka in Aspen as House Republicans tried to pass their horrible health care bill and failed. And it s not just Kushner they re pissed at   it s Trump himself.According to House staffers and other GOPers, Trump didn t seem focused when in meetings concerning the Obamacare repeal. Another unnamed Republican said: Halfway through that meeting, he stopped to talk about Gorsuch. His mind was bouncing around. I never felt they were dialed into this. Maybe next time the GOP will think twice about letting a five-year-old become their party s nominee. What we re witnessing here is the breakdown of the Republican Party, and it s so humiliating that we almost feel bad for them. Almost.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"March 25, 2017"
" Sean Spicer’s Twitter History Comes Back To Bite Him In The Ass, Trump PISSED (TWEETS)","No matter what Donald Trump does or where he goes, he s never actually doing the right thing and fulfilling his duties as POTUS.One might think that after suffering such a monstrous fail with his American Health Care Act, the president might double down and get right back to work on his quest to somehow  improve  Obamacare, which he insists is awful despite the fact the Americans overwhelmingly approve of it. But no   instead, Trump decided to spend his Saturday the way he s spent pretty much every Saturday since he became president   by playing golf.In the short 9 weeks of his presidency, Trump has already gone golfing 12 times   which is far more than any of his predecessors and former President Barack Obama, whom Trump once criticized for taking any downtime to play golf. Trump has been getting blasted for his weekend golfing getaways, and the White House has gone to great lengths to hide it:However, Trump s cover was blown when some Instagram photographs of Trump surfaced, revealing to Americans what Trump REALLY does when he has his  meetings.

 WATCH: FBI May Have VERY High-Level Witness To Blow Russia Scandal Apart,"CNN is reporting that Trump s disgraced national security adviser, Gen. Michael Flynn, may be the key to blowing apart the Russia scandal. Three of four key people, including Carter Page, Roger Stone and Paul Manafort, who have their own suspicious ties to Russia, have volunteered to speak to the House Intelligence Committee, but we haven t heard from Flynn recently. CNN s sources explain why: It is starting to look like, from my sources and then also from open reporting, that Mike Flynn is the one who may have a deal with the FBI, and that s why we have not heard from him for some time. It sounds somewhat uncertain and it is right now. However, Seth Abramson, who s an attorney and also a professor at the University of New Hampshire, broke it down this way:(1) First, as an attorney I want to make clear that, if this @CNN analyst s sources are correct, the #Russiagate scandal is blown wide open.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(2) The FBI flips witnesses, turning them into cooperating individuals, _only_ when they can help secure conviction of a bigger  target.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(3) Michael Flynn was the National Security Adviser for the President of the United States. The only _bigger_ target is Donald J. Trump.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(4) But Flynn also held a clandestine meeting with Russian ambassador/spy Sergey Kislyak and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner in December  16.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(5) And Flynn coordinated with infamous Iran-Contra figure and Russian oil/gas pipeline advocate Bud McFarlane in hiring Trump s Deputy NSA.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(6) And of course Flynn had the highest possible clearance and greatest possible access to POTUS in discussing matters of national security.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(7) Flynn s hire as NSA was controversial even suspicious when it was made due to Flynn s absolutely _terrible_ reputation in Washington.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(8) This suggests the hire wasn t based on merit, but rather the fact that Flynn is _known_ to have ties (in-person ties) to Vladimir Putin.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(9) We should conclude from the foregoing that Flynn was in the best position of _anyone_ involved in #Russiagate to see _all_ its contours.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(10) Given all of the above, we can say that if any one person could bring down Trump due to #Russiagate, it s the man the FBI may now have. pic.twitter.com/sLwjBTVTcF  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017There are reports that Flynn s spokesperson has said that Flynn will neither confirm nor deny whether he s cooperating with the FBI at this time.This is a developing story that s worth keeping an eye on, because this scandal is snowballing as more information comes out. Should CNN s story come to pass, then everyone involved, including Trump, will be in a world of shit.Even Devin Nunes, who keeps insisting that finding the leakers is mre important than getting to the bottom of the scandal, won t be able to maintain his position.Featured image by Kevin Hagen via Getty Images",News,"March 25, 2017"
 Rep. Ted Lieu Torches ‘Evil’ Donald Trump Over His Cruel Approach To Healthcare (TWEETS),"Donald Trump and Paul Ryan thought they d get to pass what could possibly be described as the most cruel approach to healthcare imaginable this past week. However, they couldn t even get members of their own party to go along with what was clearly a disaster. To that end, Trump, never one to take the blame for anything himself, decided to blame the Democrats for not voting with him on his horrible bill   even though it could have passed through the House of Representatives without so much as a single Democratic vote. Now that this excuse won t fly, Trump is back to his old line: Let Obamacare  explode. Well, Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) is calling Trump on his horrible approach to handling the Affordable Care Act. Taking to Trump s own favorite platform, Twitter, Rep. Lieu said to Trump: President Donald Trump: You truly are an evil man. Your job is to help Americans. Not intentionally try to destroy their lives. ""President"" @realDonaldTrump: You truly are an evil man. Your job is to help Americans. Not intentionally try to destroy their lives. https://t.co/2M94E1g39b  Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 25, 2017Rep.

Subverting #Obamacare violates your Oath https://t.co/2M94E1g39b  Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 25, 2017So, in other words, if Trump tries to sabotage the law, he will be in violation of his Oath of Office. Then again, he violates it every day, so what s one more instance of said violations, right?Ted Lieu is correct, though. Donald Trump is evil.

 WATCH: Joy Reid And Panel RIP House Intel Chair And Trump Stooge Devin Nunes Apart Piece By Piece,"An examination of Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes on Saturday was totally devastating and damning.This week, after FBI Director James Comey refuted Donald Trump s claim that he was wiretapped by President Obama, Nunes held a hasty press conference in a desperate effort to portray Trump as a victim whose wiretapping accusation was right all along.Nunes is in charge of the committee that is supposed to be investigating Trump s Russia scandal, but he tied the wiretapping claim into it in order to distract from the main investigation.But reporters have been digging into Nunes this week and have found some bombshells that should bring Trump and the GOP down, and Joy Reid and her panel discussed the top four.First, Nunes told Mother Jones reporter David Corn that he has never heard of Carter Page or Roger Stone, both of whom are Trump stooges with ties to Russia. Again, Nunes is the chair of the House Intelligence Committee charged with investigating Trump s ties to Russia. He should damn well know who Stone and Page are.Even Corn was  stunned  by Nunes answer and had only three possible explanations. Either he s a dimwit who hasn t read a single story about the matter he s supposed to be vetting or he has some brain disease and can t remember or he was lying to me,  Corn said.  Those are the only options I can think of. It was a bizarre moment and you re right, we could spend the next hour talking about all the weird things and bizarre things he did this week from cancelling hearings to coming forward with incomplete information to rushing to Trump. Corn then warned that Nunes demonstrated that the House Intelligence Committee is broken and is incapable of overseeing what the Executive Branch is doing. It is a breakdown, and I say this to be serious. It s the breakdown of the Congressional intelligence oversight process and the only reason we let the Executive Branch do secret work in terms of espionage, counterintelligence, counter-terrorism is because they ve overseen by the Legislative Branch. And Devin Nunes just showed this week that there is a complete breakdown in that process. Reid then turned to national security expert Malcolm Nance and asked him about why Nunes abruptly left his car after taking a phone call and disappeared for a bit. Nance opined that Nunes got called to the White House and was told to present the  incidental surveillance  as proof to vindicate Trump. Because soon after his disappearing act, Nunes called his press conference. Nance went on to call Nunes  clueless about what surveillance is. But that s not all. Reid asked Sarah Kendzior, who is an expert on authoritarian states, about Nunes taking information about the investigation to Trump.Kendzior explained that Nunes is  supposed to be watchdog but he s acting like a lapdog  and that instead of investigating, he s  acting like an informant.  She cited Nunes  behavior as just another example of Trump s corrupt regime.Scott Dworkin chimed in when Reid asked about Nunes owning part of a winery that has a direct connection to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin through a Russian investor. Dworkin pointed out that it should not be so easy to be connected to Putin and stated that Nunes should not be a congressman and he definitely shouldn t be the chairman of the intelligence committee since his wallet is so close to Putin.Here s the video via VidMe:Reid and the panel also wondered how Nunes ended up becoming the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee considering he has no intelligence experience and doesn t know much about it.But the bottom line is that Nunes just destroyed his credibility and the credibility of the committee he chairs. This investigation needs to be turned over to a special prosecutor and an independent commission because it s clear that Nunes is more interested in helping Trump cover up his Russia scandal than he is in investigating it and finding the truth.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 25, 2017"
 Trump Staff Hangs Absurdly Offensive Abraham Lincoln Banner In Mar-A-Lago Dining Room,"A few years ago, teenage pop star Justin Bieber angered many people by commenting that he thought Holocaust victim Anne Frank would have been a  belieber.

Honoring Lincoln apparently didn t include celebrating his actual accomplishments, but connecting him to Donald Trump.They were so proud of this feat of egomania that they distributed the picture in the dinner program as well.The cover of the 2017 Lincoln Day Dinner program for Republican Party of Palm Beach County tonight at Mar-a-Lago. @WPTV pic.twitter.com/SJPlB8V6qb  Andrew Lofholm (@AndrewLofholm) March 24, 2017The only person who might find this stunt in good taste is Donald Trump   who recently learned that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Great president. Most people don t even know he was a Republican. Right? Does anyone know? A lot of people don t know that. We have to build that up a little more. The Florida Republicans hosting the dinner (which, itself, is probably an ethics violation due to the fact that the current president owns the resort and will profit from it) seemed to take Trump s idea and run with it.That s an awfully big dose of wishful thinking. While it s impossible to know what a man who has been dead for 152 years would make of modern life, the idea that he would enthusiastically endorse a race-baiting grifter like Donald Trump is hard to picture. Trump couldn t even get a single living president to support him. Adding to that, the fact that Lincoln is widely regarded as perhaps America s greatest orator only makes it more unlikely that he would be impressed by a guy who can barely string two sentences together coherently.I mean, seriously  look at this garbage: Look, having nuclear my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart you know, if you re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world it s true! but when you re a conservative Republican they try oh, do they do a number. It s not exactly  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. If Lincoln were alive today, he would probably have a really articulate, beautiful way of saying  Donald Trump, go screw yourself.  I ll have to settle for saying it as plainly as that.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"March 25, 2017"
" After His Latest Major F*ck Up, Trump Heads Back To His Golf Club AGAIN","After offering Americans a sh*t sandwich for health care coverage, a plan which was slammed by conservative groups, doctors, hospitals, democrats, and liberals, Trumpcare, the Republicans attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, failed. Alleged president Donald Trump couldn t even get his own party to back his major campaign promise to eradicate Obamacare and replace it with a viable alternative. Republicans have been promising that for seven long years and the best they could come up with is tax cuts for the wealthy while the middle class and lower income Americans suffer. Naturally, Trump blamed Democrats.So what does an amateur president do after such a stunning defeat? The 70-year-old headed to Trump International Gold Club in Virginia on Saturday, reportedly for meetings, although, who he is meeting with is only open to speculation since it s not clear from pool reports.What is clear is that this marks the former reality show star s 12th visit to a golf course since his inauguration just two months ago. This also marks Trump s eighth weekend in a row making a trip to a Trump-owned property, the latter of which brings up his massive list of conflicts of interests. The former highlights his hypocrisy since he blasted Barack Obama for playing golf while he was in office.This also marks Mr. Trump's 8th consecutive weekend visit to a Trump-owned property (Mar-a-Lago club, FL golf club, VA golf club, DC hotel) https://t.co/uoLa4UvKKO  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 25, 2017Trump obviously needs a safe place to go to. The Trump-owned business, though, will profit from his presidency. This has been a reoccurring problem with the alleged billionaire, who, by the way, still refuses to release his tax returns.Each vacation Trump takes is costing the taxpayers dearly. Don t  worry,  though! As Trump put it in a tweet reportedly while he was en route to the golf club,  ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry! ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!  Donald J.

 Fox News FIRES Longtime Executive For Making Racist Remarks To Black Employees,"For years, Fox News hosts have been spewing racist remarks without consequences but apparently, when the racism is directed against their own African-American employees, the conservative network draws a line.Fox has reportedly fired longtime comptroller Judy Slater for making racist comments to black employees after her behavior was brought to the attention of her bosses.According to The Wrap,Slater, who is white and has worked at Fox for 19 years, was accused of asking one African-American employee if all three of her children were fathered by the same man, according to an individual familiar with the matter. She also referred to African American women as  sista  and stereotyped African-American employees  speech, openly complaining that they mispronounced words, the individual said.In a statement, Fox News condemned Slater s  abhorrent behavior  and claimed that such behavior is not tolerated by the network. We take any complaint of this nature very seriously and took the appropriate action in investigating and firing Ms. Slater within two weeks of this being brought to our attention. There is no place for abhorrent behavior like this at Fox News. Of course, if Fox News really takes racism seriously, they would oust personalities like Sean Hannity and Bill O Reilly, who have also made racist remarks over the years.Just last October, Hannity literally offered to send President Obama and his family back to Africa even though President Obama and his family are natural-born citizens of the United States.Nobody would have ever said this to any of our presidents who served before Obama, but Hannity did and he should have been fired on the spot.That same month, Bill O Reilly gave the green light to a segment featuring Jesse Watters mocking Asian-Americans. The segment drew instant outrage and condemnation from multiple Asian-American organizations. However, O Reilly is still on the air and Watters was promoted.O Reilly and Watters have often teamed up to reach new heights of racism, including a segment in 2015 aimed at shaming homeless black people.Fox host Jeanine Pirro should also be fired for taking racism and hate to a new level. Not only did she blame Michelle Obama for all the bad things that have happened in the world in a highly disrespectful rant, she told a black  Hamilton  actor to shut up and stick to hip-hop.So while it s good to see Fox News punishing racists in their ranks, they need to start cleaning house by firing the hosts who spew racism on the air. If Fox News truly takes racism seriously, that s what they need to do.",News,"March 25, 2017"
 ‘Pizzagate’ Conspiracy Rally Melts Down When Crowd Can’t Agree On Whether To Blame Jews,"A DC rally meant to prove  the existence of the long-debunked conspiracy theory known as  Pizzagate  reached a painfully stupid peak when the crowd couldn t agree on whether or not a secret Jewish cabal was to blame.For those that can t recall this particularly bit of idiocy coming from the right, Pizzagate was a conspiracy floated by right-wing fringe sites that claimed Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking politicians were involved in a child-sex ring in the basement of a pizza restaurant in Washington D.C. The conspiracy had been repeatedly disproven, but the requirement of having at least two brain cells and the ability to use them meant that a vocal group of nutjobs believed a cover-up was at play. It would have been mostly harmless if not for the fact that a believer of the conspiracy brought a rifle into the actual pizza place demanding to see the sex dungeon in the basement. He was arrested, but not before discovering the pizza place has no basement.His arrest did not stop the conspiracy. The remaining fanatics decided to host the DC rally to keep the conspiracy alive. Unfortunately, a gathering of this size of people dumb enough to believe the conspiracy in the first place was bound to have problems. It didn t take long for cracks to emerge. Naturally, xenophobia played a part.Members of the crowd  some of whom carpooled in a giant trailer decorated with Trump decals   grew tense when one speaker defended his personal theory that a Zionist plot was at the heart of Pizzagate. Others said they supported Israel. A fight ensued. Will Sommer of The Hill was there to witness the meltdown in all its glory:Pizzagate rally has switched into high context mode. References to international conspiracies, lines from the Book of Ephesians  Will Sommer (@willsommer) March 25, 2017Pizzagate rally divided over Zionism!

 The Wall Street Journal HUMILIATES Trump And GOP For Choking On Healthcare Bill,"Donald Trump and his Republican allies are total losers, and even the conservative-leaning Wall Street Journal admits it.The GOP proved that they are totally incapable of governing on Friday as the vote for Trumpcare failed to materialize after Republicans leaders in the House canceled the vote because they could not get the necessary support for it from their own party.It marked the second time in two days that Republicans failed to even bring their healthcare bill to the House floor for a vote.Of course, that s a good thing for the American people because the GOP plan would have gutted the Affordable Care Act, stripped health insurance from over 20 million people and caused premiums to skyrocket to prices unreachable for most Americans.But the failure to pass their own bill despite controlling Congress and the White House demonstrates once and for all that even with absolute power, Republicans are incapable of governing.For seven years, Republicans vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They rehearsed the vote to repeal it over 60 times in order to pander to their rabid base. But when it came down to it, Republicans choked under pressure from millions of Americans who angrily protested their effort to kill healthcare.In an editorial on Friday, the Wall Street Journal humiliated Trump and the GOP for failing to govern. House Republicans pulled their health-care bill shortly before a vote on Friday, and for once the media dirge is right about a GOP defeat. This is a major blow to the Trump Presidency, the GOP majority in Congress, and especially to the cause of reforming and limiting government. Republicans have campaigned for more than seven years on repealing and replacing ObamaCare, and they finally have a President ready to sign it. In the clutch they choked. Indeed, and it goes much deeper than that. For years, Republicans obstructed any and all legislation, including their own bills, all while insisting that they were capable of governing if only they could get a Republican in the White House.In November, they got their wish, but still could not pass their own bill, and the Wall Street Journal predicts that they won t repeal the Affordable Care Act at all. The risk of political suicide is not only too high to ignore, it s clear that there are conservatives who think government works best by failing to do anything. There will be no such repeal in this Congress, and probably not in any other. Republicans run the government and that means they are responsible for what happens in health care  Much of the current conservative establishment profits from fanning resentments, not governing. Legislative compromises don t help Heritage Action raise money for its perpetual outrage machine. An earlier generation of leaders at Heritage understood that the goal of winning elections was to achieve something. The current leaders seem happy with failure. In the end, the Wall Street Journal noted that this legislative failure is an  ominous  sign that Trump s presidency is a failure. Perhaps Mr. Trump and the GOP can recover from this debacle, but as an opening act to a new Presidency the collapse of his first legislative campaign is ominous. And that s particularly embarrassing because Trump has not even completed 100 days yet.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"March 25, 2017"
 Republican Has Epiphany: ‘Wracking My Brain To Think Of One [Positive] Thing Our Party Has Done’,"Just a few years after Republicans shut down the government. Then came so close to defaulting on America s debts that the nation s credit rating was reduced. Then nominated a reality television star and serial liar as president. Then elected said reality television star and serial liar to actually be president even after a tape was released where he bragged about sexual assault. Republican Representative Tom Rooney had an epiphany: Maybe  maybe the Republican Party is a joke?It may seem obvious to some, but even Republicans themselves are starting to question whether or not the GOP has a single good idea in years.Rooney s epiphany came after he watched how his party botched a healthcare reform bill that the GOP had spent seven years promising to pass. From start to finish, the effort was a spectacular failure. The bill itself was a rush job and so poorly constructed that an independent assessment of its effects found that it would result in 24 million fewer people having insurance while also not saving the country any money. The bill s popularity hovered around 17%. Then the right-wing section of the Republican Party actually revolted against the bill because it didn t kick more people off of insurance. Then Trump demanded the GOP prove its loyalty to him by passing the bill anyway   and nobody listened. The bill failed before it even got a vote, humiliating both Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan.Republicans, including Rooney, were shook. So much so that Rooney began saying the one thing you as a Republican are never supposed to say aloud.As the prospect of a loss became more real on Friday, the frustrations of GOP lawmakers loyal to the leadership began to boil over.  I ve been in this job eight years, and I m wracking my brain to think of one thing our party has done that s been something positive, that s been something other than stopping something else from happening,  Representative Tom Rooney of Florida said in an interview.  We need to start having victories as a party. And if we can t, then it s hard to justify why we should be back here. Like many Americans, it s slowly dawning on Republicans that they really are the  Party of No.  Obstructionists. Haters. Fanatics. But not lawmakers.And Rooney wasn t the only one. The healthcare bill implosion was so incredible that other conservatives were having similar thoughts:GOP aide on CapHill: ""I'm starting to think that while we're pretty good at winning elections, we're not great at the whole governing thing""  Alex Roarty (@Alex_Roarty) March 24, 2017 Not great at the whole governing thing  could very well be the official Republican motto.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"March 25, 2017"
 Petty Trump Responds To Trumpcare Failure By Hoping American Healthcare System Falls Apart,"Donald Trump is so petty about not getting his way on healthcare that he is literally hoping that our healthcare system fails.On Friday, House Republicans were forced to cancel a floor vote on their Trumpcare bill for the second time because it was heading for a massive defeat.It was a humiliating blow for a party that controls the House, Senate, and the White House.The Republican healthcare plan would have repealed the Affordable Care Act. Over 20 million Americans would have lost their health insurance and premiums would have skyrocketed.Only 17 percent of Americans supported the bill, which makes it far less popular than the Affordable Care Act.Trump immediately reacted by blaming Democrats, but again, Republicans control Congress so that excuse won t fly.On Saturday morning, Trump reacted again by expressing his hope that the healthcare system will collapse and told everyone not to worry because he will create a plan  for the people,  even though his previous attempt would have hurt millions.ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017What you just witnessed is a sitting president literally desiring the failure of our healthcare system. Also, notice that Trump has stopped saying that the Affordable Care Act  is imploding  and is instead now saying that it  will explode.  It sounds like Trump just admitted that the Affordable Care Act was not crumbling as he previously claimed. Now he is just making a prediction.Of course, Twitter users responded by humiliating Trump for failing to gut the Affordable Care Act and torched him for hoping that healthcare fails in America.@realDonaldTrump To be clear: Trump s plan at this point is to try to slowly degrade health care then blame the ACA.

 WATCH: Conservative Group BRAINLESSLY Ran These Ads Cheering Trumpcare AFTER It Died,"Trump and the House GOP suffered a stunning defeat on legislation they promised would deliver better healthcare to millions, despite that promise being a lie. They pulled the Trumpcare bill from the floor early Friday afternoon, before getting a vote, because they knew it wouldn t pass. And that was absolutely humiliating for them.But what may be more humiliating is what the American Action Network a conservative PAC did on Friday night   the exact same day the bill failed. During Friday night basketball games, they ran television ads about the triumph of Trumpcare over Obamacare, saying the following: Republicans are keeping their promise with a new plan for better hrealthcare, More choices and lower costs, putting doctors and patients in charge again. No more big government penalties or job killing mandates. They go on to explain that the tax credits contained within Trumpcare would make healthcare more affordable, and that protections for people with pre-existing conditions would remain in place (which wasn t necessarily true).And then they do something truly amazing, given that these ads ran long after all the drama from the bill s death had quieted down. Watch one of these ads below:Why didn t they have these pulled? That just makes them look completely moronic.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"March 25, 2017"
 WATCH: Fox Host Declares GOP Trumpcare Failure A Victory For President Obama,"President Obama has finally been vindicated after seven years of Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act resulted in humiliating failure on Friday.Once again, Republicans were forced to cancel a floor vote for their Trumpcare bill the day after previously pulling it because many Republicans couldn t bring themselves to vote for such a terrible piece of legislation.The bill would have repealed the Affordable Care Act, stripping healthcare from over 20 million Americans and causing healthcare premiums to skyrocket.Donald Trump, of course, immediately blamed Democrats for the defeat even though Republicans control the House, Senate, and the White House.In short, Republicans only have themselves to blame because they are the ones who tried to replace the Affordable Care Act with a plan that was just awful and universally opposed across the country.Adding insult to injury, Fox News anchor Bret Baier forcefully pointed out that while Republicans went down in flames, President Obama won the day. Let me just say one thing, the biggest winner today: President Barack Obama, who came out this week and defended his legacy healthcare law,  Baier began.  It is now clear that Republicans cannot do, at least yet, what they planned on doing in the campaign, after campaign from 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016,  repeal and replace  was the mantra. Indeed, Republicans rehearsed their repeal of the Affordable Care Act incessantly, holding over 60 useless symbolic votes over the years. But when push came to shove, Republicans demonstrated that they are incapable of governing even when they control every branch of government. Barack Obama has the win right now, and it has changed the entire way that we look at healthcare,  Baier continued.  It is now the Democrats  version, the ideology, that government does have a role in providing healthcare in some way shape or form. Thousands of Americans across the country showed up at town halls to confront Republicans in defense of the Affordable Care Act and only 17 percent of Americans approved of their bill.And in the end, not enough Republicans were willing to commit political suicide by supporting the bill and decided to stand against it instead.In conclusion, Baier echoed Fox Business host Stuart Varney by noting that Republicans control Congress and the White House but still could not get anything done. The repeal, drag it up by the root has not worked,  Baier said.  They can t get it through a Republican House, a Republican Senate and a Republican president. Today is a win for President Barack Obama. Here s the video via YouTube.Americans should remain vigilant, however, and continue to watch Republicans closely to make sure they don t try to sneak the bill through. Just like the Affordable Care Act failed a few times before it passed, the GOP could always bring up their terrible bill again for another vote. It will be up to each and every one of us to make sure they fail again. But for now, the Affordable Care Act is the law and Republicans should accept that and get over it.Featured image via Pete Souza",News,"March 24, 2017"
 RNC Paid TENS of THOUSANDS To Intel Firm With MASSIVE Russian Ties To Dig Up Dirt On Hillary,"During the campaign cycle, payments from the Republican National Committee to this company called the Hamilton Trading Group drew some attention because the RNC said they were payments for an assessment of building security at RNC headquarters in Washington and it looked unusual on a financial disclosure form. That was the RNC s story, as well as that of Hamilton s co-founder, Ben Wickham, and they stuck to it.Until recently. Most of the $41,500 the RNC paid to Hamilton actually went towards intelligence-gathering for the purpose of digging up dirt on Hillary Clinton. Wickham, an ex-CIA officer, insisted at the time that his work was entirely for building security, but now he s saying that he  wasn t totally forthcoming  because the dirt-digging they did was protected under a non-disclosure agreement.The big kicker is that Hamilton has strong connections in Russia. They ve done background checks and provided security services for American companies and officials   work that was done by an ex-KGB agent. According to Wickham, Gennady Vasilenko has  very good contacts in Russia.  However, he also claims never to have had any contact with Donald Trump, Paul Manafort, or any of their people, and that their work has nothing to do with Russia itself.We re pretty sure at this point that Russia hacked the DNC and began releasing batches of documents and emails that were damaging to the DNC for the purpose of helping Trump and harming Hillary. That the RNC worked with a company, which has its own ties to Russia, to build two dossiers on Hillary that supposedly showed she intervened on behalf of energy companies that had donated to the Clinton Foundation in both Israel and Bulgaria just compounds their growing  Russia problem. Trump has people on his team in the White House that have their own ties to Russia. House Intel chair Devin Nunes may have his own ties. Now the RNC itself admits to paying a company with heavy connections to Russia to dig up dirt on Hillary Clinton during the election. This has been out of control for a long time.Featured image by Justin Sullivan via Getty Images",News,"March 24, 2017"
 Schumer Goes ALL IN On ‘Incompetent’ Trump White House After Healthcare Bill Fails,"The Republican Party and the Trump White House just suffered a humiliating defeat as their signature campaign promise   to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act immediately   couldn t even pass a vote on the House floor with a large GOP majority.Of course, this is a major victory for Democrats, and a political disaster for Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wasted no time in blasting the Republicans  inability to govern, and the Trump White House in particular. In a press conference shortly after the bill failed, Schumer said: The TrumpCare bill failed because of two traits that have plagued the Trump presidency since he took office: incompetence and broken promises.  I have never seen an administration as incompetent as the one occupying the White House. Schumer went on to openly mock Trump s own claim to fame   deal-making. He snarked,  so much for the art of the deal,  referencing Trump s famous book. Schumer went on to say that Trumpcare should be abandoned in favor of fixing Obamacare: They should depart the field, cut their losses and abandon their quixotic attempt to pass TrumpCare once and for all. Schumer then reminded Republicans that he is willing to work with them on a fix for Obamacare, but will not be helping them to repeal anything to do with the Affordable Care Act: What we said, we stand by. If they would denounce repeal .then we ll work with them on improving [ObamaCare] and making it better. But they can t continue to want to repeal. Schumer went on to remind everyone of a truth that we see every time Republicans are in power: They are very good at criticizing. They re not very good at governing. Schumer also waved away Trump s pathetic attempt to blame Democrats for the bill s failure, and even went so far as to essentially call him a liar: It s another one of his big tall tales. He couldn t get enough Republican votes, he never tried to reach out to Democrats in any way. So the blame falls with president trump and with the Republicans. Indeed. They know how to be against things, how to try and pass draconian laws that are way outside the mainstream opinion of the American people. But when it comes to actually making lives better and making government work, they haven t a clue.Thanks for your candor, Senator Schumer.

 Trump Goes Ballistic Following His AHCA Defeat: The REAL Losers ‘Are Pelosi And Schumer!’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump drew a line in the sand: Pass the Obamacare repeal and replace bill or else.Then it blew up in his face.

 Authors Of Failed GOP Bill Which Would Have Kicked 24 Million Off Insurance Reportedly ‘Near Tears’,"The authors of the Republican bill that would have caused as many as 24 million people to lose health insurance and bankrupt countless others are reportedly  near tears  and  demoralized  following the bill s failure to make it through the house.Guys who wrote this bill are in shock.

So close to that goal, he looked tired and defeated at a press conference held immediately after the bill s implosion. He admitted that the Affordable Care Act is likely here to stay.Ryan s bedraggled look led to at least one epic joke at his expense:Texas Republican Jodey Arrington was equally crestfallen.The lone Texas Republican freshman, Rep Jodey Arrington, backed the bill and is incredibly demoralized.

 Paul Ryan Admits Obamacare Will Be Law ‘For The Foreseeable Future’ After GOP Bill FAILS (VIDEO),"Well, folks, your health care is safe for the  foreseeable future  according to Speaker Paul Ryan. After the GOP abruptly pulled their healthcare bill from consideration Friday, spirits among the worst among us were pretty dim. We just pulled it,  Donald Trump told the Washington Post after the decision to nix the embarrassing disaster of a bill, noting that he doesn t  blame  Ryan for this huge loss. Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains. We re feeling those growing pains today,  Ryan told reporters, noting that  this is a disappointing day  for those whose biggest dream is stripping healthcare from millions and that  doing big things is hard. All of us, all of us   myself included   will need to time to reflect on how we got to this moment,  he added.How we got to this moment is that the Affordable Care Act is immensely popular. While it could use some improvements   like a move toward universal healthcare   the GOP s effort to  repeal and replace  is not as popular with voters as it may have seemed on the campaign trail.But they won t actually reflect on that, will blame Obama, and will present Americans with something equally horrible somewhere down the line.Ryan was forced to utter one of the most beautiful 22 words we have heard since Donald Trump was kinda-sorta elected by less than half of the population: ObamaCare will remain the law of the land until it s replaced. We re going to be living with ObamaCare for the foreseeable future. The president gave his all in this effort. He did everything he possibly could to help people see the opportunity we have with this bill. He really has been fantastic,  Ryan said. Still, we have to do better and we will. This battle is won.

 GOP In CHAOS As Obamacare Vote Goes Down In Flames (DETAILS),"The entire Republican Party spent the 2016 campaign season running on a promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. However, now that they have the House, the Senate, and the White House, they re like a dog who caught a car it s been chasing for years, and they can t agree on what to do.This entire week has been spent with party members bickering amongst themselves, and many members of the GOP House Conference in open revolt against Paul Ryan s repeal and replace bill. In fact, the bill was so terrible and would cost so many people their health coverage, that even Donald Trump wouldn t put his name on it. The White House has openly said not to dub the plan  Trumpcare. Well, it seems that for now, there will be no Obamacare repeal. In fact, there won t even be a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has pulled the bill because it seems it became clear Friday afternoon that they would not have the votes to get this mess of a healthcare reform bill past the House, much less past the Senate. Of course, this comes just one day after Trump gave House Republicans an ultimatum: Either hold a vote or there will be no Obamacare repeal on his watch, period.That really should come as no surprise, given Trump s low level of patience, short attention span, and penchant for throwing tantrums. He also reportedly said to those voting  No,  on the bill,  I m gonna come after you.  So, who really knows what will come of the relationship between the White House and Congress after this; after all, it was already just a lukewarm marriage of convenience.Well, we ve given the GOP a chance to govern. They have all three branches of the federal government. And they have instead descended into utter chaos in 60 days flat, have been fielding scandal after scandal, and have gotten nothing done. Time to give it back to the Democrats, because it s clear that the Republicans can t handle it.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"March 24, 2017"
 Ivanka Trump Gets BURIED By People Calling Her Out For Letting Her Dad Kill Women’s Healthcare,"Ivanka Trump is catching hell right now for being a hypocrite when it comes to women s healthcare.In 2016, Ivanka Trump campaign for her dad by claiming that his administration would support a variety of women s issues including maternity leave.However, Donald Trump s desperate effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act would wipe out maternity care, mammograms, contraception, and would make the cost of healthcare for women skyrocket because insurance companies would be allowed to once again classify being a woman as a pre-existing condition.In short, for all of Ivanka s claims that her dad will be a champion for women, he is proving her to be a total liar. And what s worse is that she is doing nothing to stand up for women.And that s why Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards called out Ivanka on Friday and warned her not to betray women. It s time for Ivanka to   stand for women,  Richards said before calling Ivanak s silence on the bill  deafening. Currently, Ivanka is on a swanky ski trip in Aspen while Republicans prepare to gut healthcare for millions of women across the country. This is going to be a catastrophe for women in this country,  Richards continued.  Any woman who votes for this bill is betraying every woman in America. Women will lose not just their healthcare, but lose their lives over this bill. Here s the video via YouTube.Ivanka s refusal to help women by standing up to her dad has also created a firestorm on her Twitter feed as even more people called her out on social media for being a hypocrite in response to her praise of a paid leave speech delivered by actress Anne Hathaway.@IvankaTrump Now that you ve got an office in the West Wing, how about you stand up for women in the current healthcare discussion?

 WATCH: Hell Freezes As Fox News Host Calls Republican Party A ‘Disgrace’ For Being Incapable Of Governing,"Things just went from bad to worse for the Republican Party.Being in charge just isn t what Republicans imagined it would be like.After all, they have majority control of the House and Senate and have the perfect puppet in the White House to rubber stamp their destructive agenda.But millions of angry Americans across the country, including Democrats, Republicans, and independents, have made Republicans in Congress incredibly nervous about the GOP healthcare bill. Nervous enough to actually oppose it.The Trumpcare bill would strip healthcare away from 20 million Americans and cause premiums to skyrocket, both of which Donald Trump promised would not happen. In short, he lied, and many Republicans don t want to commit political suicide with him.The Republican failure to pass their terrible bill is good for the American people, but it s politically harmful to the GOP because their failure to pass their own bill despite having majority control makes them look incompetent of governing.Keep in mind that Republicans have insisted for years that they are more capable of governing the United States than Democrats. But when Americans actually put them in charge of the entire government it turns out Republicans were all talk and no walk.Rather than govern, Republicans have let Trump systematically destroy this country and now they have failed miserably in their first effort to pass a major policy on their agenda.And even Fox News is disgusted by how Republicans have performed.During his show on Fox Business on Friday, stalwart Republican cheerleader Stuart Varney literally called the entire Republican Party a  disgrace  and conceded that  they can t govern,  much to the surprise of Juan Williams. I personally believe at this moment in time, the Republican Party is a disgrace,  Varney declared.  I m serious. I am serious. We elected the Republicans to run the House, the Senate and the White House and the very, very first thing that comes up on the legislative agenda they vote no, they re split. They can t do it. They can t govern. I am really fit to be tied. Varney invited Williams to take shots at him and the GOP but he declined to do so, opting instead to point out that the Republicans who oppose this bill are doing so because it s a bad bill.Here s the video via YouTube:Indeed, the bill is not better than the Affordable Care Act. In fact, it kills all of the good things the Affordable Care Act provides and takes America back to a time when the uninsured rate was shockingly high and people had to choose between paying for healthcare or paying their bills to avoid homelessness and starvation.But Republicans only have themselves to blame what the position they are in right now. Rather than supporting a law that includes many Republican ideas such as an individual mandate, they chose to viciously oppose the law instead and demonize it for political gain. Furthermore, they had seven years to come up with a better healthcare plan and couldn t even do that. More Americans now understand that the Affordable Care Act was not the evil Republicans portrayed it to be and they now want to save it. Americans are learning about all the good things Republicans would be destroying by repealing it.And now even Fox News is having a hard time defending Republicans on this issue. And losing the support of their propaganda machine should signal to Republicans that they have royally f*cked up.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 24, 2017"
 Democrats Offer Bill That Would FORCE Trump To Keep One Of His Promises,"The vast majority of Donald Trump s campaign promises were both unworkable and, well, hateful. His promise to  lock (Hillary Clinton) up,  was as empty as it was unifying for those on the rabid right. It was the same with his promise to build a wall along the Mexican border and his promise to  repeal and replace  Obamacare on day one. Occasionally, though, like a broken clock, Trump occasionally got it right, and now Democrats want him to make good on one such promise.Despite the fact that nearly everything Trump adorns with his name is made elsewhere, one of the cornerstones of his presidential campaigns was to force manufacturers to employ Americans.Republicans are doing everything in their power to ensure that Trump doesn t get to keep this campaign promise. There s a bill in the Senate that would help deliver clean water to Americans and help Flint, Michigan with emergency funding. Originally, there was a  buy American and hire American  provision in the bill. That should be non-controversial, right? Well, Republicans, who seem to stand against absolutely everything that s good and right, stripped that part out of the bill back in December. Now Dems want them to bring it back.Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis) reintroduced the provision to the bill:Dem senator to reintroduce #BuyAmerica legislation @thehill https://t.co/uRuOOH9Bbg  Sen. Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) March 24, 2017 Now is the time for President Trump to decide if he will keep his promises by supporting this legislation, or will he go along to get along with Congressional Republicans who have embraced the status quo and blocked this legislation that puts in place a strong Buy America standard,  said Baldwin, who planned to announce the bill at a Wisconsin foundry that makes manhole covers for cities throughout the United States.  The choice for the Republican establishment in Washington is clear: Do you stand with American manufacturers and workers or do you support spending taxpayer dollars on Chinese and Russian steel for American water infrastructure projects? Source: IB TimesDem senator to reintroduce #BuyAmerica legislation @thehill https://t.co/uRuOOH9Bbg  Sen. Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) March 24, 2017Baldwin s bill deals with the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which in the last two decades has delivered nearly $28 billion in financing for more than 12,000 drinking-water projects across the country. Her legislation would mandate that moving forward, the program targets its funding to projects that use only American-made iron and steel.It s unlikely the bill will pass with this provision, but it does put Trump s feet to the fire. If he signs the Republican version (which he almost certainly will), it will be just more evidence that the emperor has no clothes.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"March 24, 2017"
 WATCH: Rachel Maddow Laughs At Republican Effort To Pass Universally Hated Trumpcare Bill,"House Republicans failed to pass their disastrous healthcare bill on Thursday and Rachel Maddow hilariously mocked them for it.Due to the deep unpopularity of the legislation, Republican leadership decided to cancel the vote on the bill at the last minute rather than see it get humiliatingly defeated.Many Republicans are leaning against the bill because it fails to lower premiums and would strip healthcare away from over 20 million Americans, many of whom are conservatives who rely on the Affordable Care Act, which actually does keep premiums lower and covers more people.Under the Trumpcare bill, senior citizens would have to pay nearly ten times as much money on healthcare than what they currently pay under the Affordable Care Act. And since senior citizens are a major voting block for the GOP for some reason, Republicans are backing away from the bill.Of course, Republicans have been rehearsing the repeal of the Affordable Care Act for years, holding over 60 separate votes in the House over the years just to make their conservative base happy. But now that more people understand what the Affordable Care Act actually has done, they are fiercely opposing any repeal effort.Rachel Maddow noted the angry crowds of constituents at Republican town halls and pointed out with a laugh that the GOP bill is more unpopular than despised New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the universe, including our weird politics. A day after the election, nobody would have told you that Republicans would have any trouble repealing Obamacare. That s what they could do on their own, they d push on an open door. The Affordable Care Act, they d been rehearsing repealing it for years. It would definitely be their first casualty, no problem. Then they d get on to the hard stuff. But people all over the country in every congressional district in the country changed the course of that otherwise inevitable history.The Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act has a 17 percent approval rating. That s worse than Chris Christie. There is not a single Congressional district in this country where the number of people who like the Republican idea out-number the people who strongly hate the Republican idea. Not in a single Congressional district. That happens for a reason. That political climate doesn t exist in nature, it is created by people engaged in political action. Maddow concluded the 2-minute segment by reminding everyone that Republicans failed to pass their bill despite having majority control of the House and said it s all thanks to people who have added their voices to the chorus of those opposed to killing a law that actually helps people. For the people who have been trying to save the Affordable Care Act all over the country, even what just happened tonight is huge,  Maddow said.  Everybody thought Republicans would be able to move at will on this but people said nope. Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump s healthcare plan would literally kill people in this country and that s not right. It s inhumane. It forces people to choose between getting medical care or not going bankrupt and that s morally wrong. Healthcare is a human right and it s a need that no one should be priced out of having.If Republicans somehow ram this legislation down our throats they should be brutally punished for it. Because any lawmaker who supports something that kills people is not someone who should be in public office.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 24, 2017"
 Adam Schiff SAVAGES Republicans For Canceling Hearing On Russia Collusion To Please Trump,"If you were unaware, there was a much-anticipated hearing on the collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence operatives during the election scheduled on Tuesday   key word  was. Because The Donald totally has nothing to hide at all, the GOP nixed those plans. The public hearing was to feature former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who was fired by Trump for doing her job, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper   both of whom are figures Republicans do not want to allow near a microphone.Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff announced on Friday that Trump transition team member and chairman of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Rep. Devin Nunes canceled the hearing.BREAKING: Chairman just cancelled open Intelligence Committee hearing with Clapper, Brennan and Yates in attempt to choke off public info.  Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) March 24, 2017Schiff also criticized Nunes for running a  dead of night excursion  for documents related to surveillance of Trump associates while leaving the rest of the committee  in the dark. We strongly object to the cancellation of this hearing,  Schiff says.  We would still urge the majority to reconsider. The witnesses have made it clear to us they are still available and we would urge that that hearing be allowed to go forward. Recently, Nunes gave us a clear indicator that he is compromised when he ran directly to The Donald with alleged information showing that information regarding Trump and his team was perfectly legally incidentally collected while intelligence agencies were monitoring some pretty nasty people overseas. He did not share this information with his fellow Congressmen and women.There is no question now. There is no defense. Republicans   not just Trump and his immediate team   are not working for the American people. At this point, we have no choice but to accept them for what they are: the enemy of the American people.Featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)",News,"March 24, 2017"
 SPINELESS: Paul Ryan Actually RAN AWAY From Reporters After Trumpcare FAIL (VIDEO),"Everyone knows Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has absolutely no backbone, but what he did yesterday was an entirely new low for the Republican Party.Yesterday was a disaster for the GOP to begin with. Donald Trump pathetically failed to gain enough votes for the disastrous American Health Care Act, and the GOP suffered a major humiliation as the glorious plan they ve been promising to implement and do away with Obamacare with for the past seven years deteriorates before their eyes. After such a horrible, embarrassing day, it was clear that Ryan didn t have it in him to face the press and answer the many critical questions that Americans have about Trumpcare.Ryan emerged from the failed discussions over Trumpcare, visibly frustrated and not in the mood to make nice with reporters. He gave a short statement in which he was clearly angry and uncomfortable: For seven and a half years, we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it s collapsing and it s failing families, and tomorrow we re proceeding. He ended his address abruptly, literally running off and away from reporters demanding answers. You can watch this disgusting behavior below, courtesy of the Rachel Maddow Show: This is clearly a sign that the GOP knows how badly they ve just failed, and they re aware of how pathetic the party looks right now. This could not be a more painful time for the GOP   their disastrous reality television star of a candidate won the election and even though he s only been in the White House a little more than two months, he s f*cked things up more than anyone thought he would. With Trump s help, the Republican Party has done irreversible damage to its reputation   and they only have themselves to thank. Ryan s cowardly behavior only solidifies the fact that the GOP is crumbling before our very eyes.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 24, 2017"
 WATCH: Trump’s Head Will Explode With Rage When He Hears What Lawrence O’Donnell Said About Him,"MSNBC host Lawrence O Donnell did not hold back on Thursday night.Earlier in the day, House Republican leadership saw the writing on the wall and canceled the vote on their healthcare bill.So far, 27 Republicans are leaning against the legislation it does nothing that Donald Trump promised it would do like lower premiums and cover everyone.Indeed, the bill would make premiums skyrocket uncontrollably and would strip healthcare from over 20 million Americans. Senior citizens would suffer the brunt of the financial pain as they would would be charged ten times as much for health insurance under the bill than they are under the Affordable Care Act, which really has made health insurance more accessible and affordable.But after the vote in the House was canceled, Trump lashed out at House Republicans and demanded that a vote be taken on the bill on Friday because he refuses to negotiate any longer on it.So during his show on Thursday night, Lawrence O Donnell took Trump to the woodshed for quitting and noted that President Obama never quit trying to get the Affordable Care Act passed. If you are a House Republican and this is a tough vote for you, the president is saying to you on the front page of the New York Times tomorrow,  I quit, and I quit in the Senate. I do not have the patience or the ability to stay focused on this and get it through the Senate,  which is much harder than getting it through the House. O Donnell is absolutely right. Senate Republicans are even more concerned about the Trumpcare legislation. If passed, the damage will even touch their own voter base, which could result in the Senate flipping back to the control of the Democrats. The Senate is much more vulnerable to being lost than the House is since Republicans have guaranteed control of the House through gerrymandering.But O Donnell had even stronger words for Trump just a few seconds later. This is the laziest, most ignorant president in history,  O Donnell declared.  President Obama never once said something like this in the crusade to get that thing passed because he knew how to stay with it and get it passed. Here s the video via YouTube:Trump is throwing a fit because he expects Congress to ass whatever he wants them to pass and it just doesn t work that way. The Congressional Budget Office analysis of the bill was disastrous for the GOP. And the bill is hated more by Americans than the Affordable Care Act ever was. And thousands of their constituents have showed up at Republican town halls across the country to express their anger over their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.In the end, letting this bill die is probably the best move Republicans can make unless, of course, they propose replacing the Affordable Care Act with universal healthcare. But we all know that will never happen even though it would cover everyone and bring the cost of healthcare down dramatically.One thing is certain, though. When Donald Trump hears what O Donnell just said about him his head is going to explode.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 24, 2017"
" Woman CORNERS GOP Senator Trapped On Flight, DEMANDS Explanation To Trumpcare (DETAILS)","A Republican Senator found himself in a tough position when he was trapped on a flight with an American citizen who wanted answers about the disgusting repeal and replacement of Obamacare.Oklahoma resident Kendall Brown noticed that she was on the same flight as Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) on Thursday evening, and decided to take him up on his claim that he would  listen to all voices  if anyone had questions about the GOP s new health care bill. Brown had previously sent letters, emails, and tweets to Lankford, but so far she had been unable to get a response to her questions. However, now that she realized Lankford was trapped on the same airplane with her, she decided this was a great opportunity to get some answers.Once Brown noticed Lankford, she posted a photo of him to her Facebook page, and soon people were begging her to ask him questions. Brown first tried to get Lankford s attention on Twitter, asking him to chat with her about Trump s disastrous plan to repeal and replace Obamacare:  However, Brown still didn t get a response. Twitter users even began to suggest that Brown try to approach him in person. Brown opted to write him a note, and by the time she was finished she must have gotten Lankford s attention because he actually approached her!Lankford asked Brown  specifically  what her question was and she said: I want to share my story with you and I want to have my voice heard on why the ACA is important to me. The conversation ended with an agreement to speak sometime in the near future about the GOP s bill at length.UPDATE: I spoke with @SenatorLankford and gave him this. I m very hopeful we ll be able to get coffee this week & look forward to chatting! pic.twitter.com/AtbRwkJm6P  Kendally Brown ? (@kendallybrown) March 24, 2017While Brown doesn t think Lankford will meet her in person, she hopes they might chat on the phone. She is passionate about addressing her concerns with Lankford, because earlier that day Lankford said in an interview that he would  listen to all voices    something that Brown doesn t think he truly means, considering he hasn t held a town hall on the topic yet. She said: He pretty specifically isn t listening to all voices right now and that s why I approached him. I know there are a lot of people out there that have just as compelling stories about why they need the ACA. So, I had an obligation to approach him, not just for me but for everyone. As Brown s story has gotten more attention, her social media accounts are now full of stories from Americans stating how Obamacare helped them. Brown says she is going to print these stories out and give them to Lankford so he can see how disastrous the repeal and replacement of Obamacare might be.Featured image via Kendally Brown Facebook",News,"March 24, 2017"

" FBI: After Blocking Trump’s Muslim Ban, Hawaii Judge Inundated With Threats","After a federal court struck down the new version of the Muslim ban (which was basically just like the first one) Donald Trump called it  judicial overreach  at a rally in Nashville, Tennessee, and said that it makes our country look  weak.  And now, the federal judge in Hawaii who ruled against Trump s newest version of a Muslim ban is inundated with threatening messages since the ruling, according to the FBI. Hours before the ban was to go into effect, US District Judge Derrick Watson s ruling resulted in a temporary restraining order nationwide. This was the second time a court ruled against Trump s executive order which resulted in chaos worldwide. Travellers were in mid-flight after the alleged president signed the first one. Protests at airports ensued after people were detained without notice.The FBI did not provide details as to the location the threats are coming from, however, the agency did say they are coming from within the mainland.The U.S. Marshals Service has had to fly in about a dozen deputies from the mainland to provide 24-hour protection for Watson, according to HawaiiNewsNow. The FBI said it will assist the the U.S. Marshals Service if necessary to protect the judge. The illogic of the government s contentions is palpable. The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed,  Watson wrote in the ruling. Trump s own words were used against him in the ruling.Hawaii News Now   KGMB and KHNLThreats against a federal judge or his or her family is a federal crime and is considered obstruction of justice. Trump went on a tweetstorm against the first federal judge who ruled against his travel ban.Even Neil Gorsuch, Trump s Supreme Court nominee who is hoping to take Merrick Garland s stolen seat, called the alleged president s tweets attacking federal judges  disheartening  and  demoralizing.  Still yet, White House press secretary Sean Spicer denied that Gorsuch was referring to Trump.More than one judge has been the target of threats after Trump publicly criticized them. That includes a Seattle judge known for his conservative legal views, who was appointed by George W. Bush.It s clear that Trump is inciting these threats, knowing full well that his die-hard supporters will do his bidding. LOCK HIM UP!Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News,"March 24, 2017"
 Trump Just Issued A New But Utterly USELESS Threat On Endangered Trumpcare Bill,"The  American Health Care Plan,  a.k.a. AHCA or  Trumpcare,  didn t get the vote Thursday that it was supposed to because there are too many Republicans in Congress that won t vote for it. Trump has been trying to bully them into doing so, including threatening the jobs of Republicans who vote against it. Now, though, he s made what he no doubt thinks is his most terrifying threat yet, except it s really not.He s threatened to leave Obamacare in place if Trumpcare fails in Congress.If you re sitting there scratching your head, you aren t alone. The ACA, also known as the dreaded Obamacare, would remain in place and intact regardless of what Trump does. The question is who would be responsible for that, politically, and the answer is and has always been Republicans. Trump seems to think he can hold that over their heads to force a vote.Mick Mulvaney, the White House s budget director, has even told House Republicans that Trump is done with negotiations and just wants a vote now. He said that if they vote the bill down, then Trump will just proceed to work on other parts of his agenda. Which, really, is the obvious option.One has to ask: Does Trump really think that he s going to cow intransigent Republicans this way? Should Trumpcare fail, the ACA would remain the law of the land regardless of what Trump does because he can t repeal it all on his own.There are House Republicans that aren t part of the intransigent Freedom Caucus who have said they can t back the modified bill, which is considerably worse than the original bill. There s also the fact that Senate Republicans have already said they don t have the votes to pass Trumpcare.To appease one side, such as the Freedom Caucus, Republicans have to alienate another side, like moderates. They re stuck between a rock and a hard place on this   and it s a situation that Trump s bullying can t really make worse.There s a small chance that the bill will pass the House tomorrow, but with the Freedom Caucus and moderates being unhappy with the bill, it will probably fail. If it fails, Obamacare will remain the law of the land. Republicans already know they ll bear the burden of that. Trump s threat is ridiculous.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"March 24, 2017"
 WATCH: Jake Tapper Mocks Republicans HARD On CNN For Humiliating Failure To Pass Trumpcare,"House Republicans had seven years to come up with a plan superior to the Affordable Care Act and their plan is so bad that not even the GOP majority could pass it.After uselessly voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act over sixty times during those years in order to please their conservative base, Republicans appear to be chickening out from actually doing it.Because once the dubiously named American Healthcare Act passes, it would strip health care from over 20 million Americans, many of whom are Republican voters for some reason.The bill would also cause the price of healthcare to skyrocket, especially for senior citizens who would have to pay ten times as much as they do right now under the Affordable Care Act.Anyway, the vote on the Republican bill was scheduled for Thursday, but once Republican leadership realized that they could muster enough members of their own party to get the necessary number of votes, they canceled the vote.Seriously. Republicans control the House and they couldn t even bring up their own bill for an up or down vote. Simply put, it was a humiliating failure of epic proportions.Once Donald Trump found the egg on his face, he immediately demanded that House Republicans vote on Friday. And so we now wait for the moment when Trump suffers a major policy defeat because Republicans discovered that repealing the Affordable Care Act isn t such a great idea after all.Adding to the humiliation on Thursday was CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who pointed out how long Republicans have been having their collective wet-dream about repealing the signature achievement of America s first black president, and then mocked them for failing to do so. It turns out it s a lot easier for Republican leaders to say  repeal and replace  than to do it,  Tapper said. Seven years ago today, the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare was signed into law by President Obama and since that time Republicans have been planning, hoping, dreaming for this day, the moment where they could finally repeal Obamacare and replace it with their own solution to the nation s health care mess. They have had seven years to prepare for this day.Now weeks after optimistic talk from House leaders, declarations from White House secretary Sean Spicer that  the bill will pass the House tonight and there is no Plan B,  well, the bill was in such peril Republican leaders pulled it and postponed the vote. And what critics are calling an  embarrassing and ignominious move,  so humiliating, it signifies the only thing worse would have been to actually bring it to a vote where Republican leaders were apparently confident it would die. Here s the video via YouTube:If this bill fails to pass it will be a humiliating defeat for Trump and Republicans, but it will be a glorious victory for the American people and the millions who rely on the Affordable Care Act to help get and keep accessible and affordable health insurance.So as Friday approaches, Americans need to urge their Republican representatives to vote against the bill. Because if Trump is able to bully the holdouts into voting for it, he can bully them into voting for anything and then America is truly screwed.Featured image via Cagle",News,"March 23, 2017"
 Meet The Girl Republicans Are Trying Like Hell To Kill (VIDEO),"Republicans are hell bent on repealing Obamacare. They don t care how many people it kills. After eight years of demanding the Affordable Care Act be repealed and replaced, the best they could come up with when they finally won the majority, was a plan that will kick 24 million people off of their health insurance. The proposed bill was especially cruel to the elderly, the sick, and the disabled. Thankfully, the American Health Care Act didn t make it past Thursday s House vote, but only because a significant number of Republicans didn t think it was cruel enough.This is Ashley, and she is one of the many people the Republicans are trying to put into an early grave.A few years ago, when she was only 22 years old, Ashley was diagnosed with Lupus, an autoimmune disease in which the body s own immune system turns on itself and attacks various organs throughout the body. Ashley s case proved to be severe. Among other things, the Lupus has attacked her brain, which causes seizures.Her entire digestive system is paralyzed, a condition called gastroparesis. She is unable to eat or take any medications by mouth because it just sits in her stomach until it is eventually vomited back up several days later. She has had multiple feeding tubes surgically implanted, which allowed liquid nutritional supplements to be delivered directly into her intestines. But in Ashley, the gastroparesis has paralyzed her intestines too.Because of this, Ashley has relied on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for more than two years   in other words, she is fed through an IV. She has had multiple ports installed in her chest over the years, along with a countless number of PICC lines. Anytime you see her, she will have her trusty backpack carrying her TPN pump which feeds her through a tube in her chest from the IV bag she lugs around.Just to make things fun, Ashley s body has decided to develop a blood clotting disorder that doctors have not yet been able to diagnose or identify. She has repeatedly had potentially fatal DVT s over the past few months, including a particularly dangerous one in her neck that developed even after she was placed on high doses of blood thinners.Now that you have a little background, and rest assured that this is only a small snapshot of her overall medical picture, I will get back to my point because this isn t a sob story. Ashley is a fighter and the only thing she needs less than pity is the GOP s  make America sick again  plan.Ashley is alive because West Virginia chose to take part in the Medicaid expansion. Republicans want to gut Medicaid, and West Virginia s budget is already pushed to the max. If there have to be cuts, expensive patients like Ashley will be the first to go and spending caps in the AHCA would do just this. Getting her treatments approved are already a nightmare. If the GOP gets their way, this girl will die. She won t live long enough fight it or look for other options. Without Medicaid, Ashley will die. Period.I would like to think that putting a face on this would compel a little compassion from the right, but Republicans don t give a f*ck about Ashley or any of the other sick Americans they are trying so hard to kill. After all, their only complaint about the GOP plan is that it isn t going to kill enough people.You can watch Ashley talk more about her illness here, via the Invisible Disability Project: Featured image via Facebook",News,"March 23, 2017"
 Desperate GOP LITERALLY Spreads Trump’s Wiretap Lies To Fleece Their Supporters,"It was bound to happen   as soon as House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes said that he had evidence people in Trump s transition team were recorded during foreign surveillance activities, Trump and his loyal subjects within the Republican Party pounced. Never mind what else Nunes said that the information collected was incidental and probably legal the GOP saw their opportunity to clear their president s name and paint Obama as the evil, criminal, dictatorial president they always  knew  he was.The National Republican Congressional Committee sent out emails this morning with the subject line,  Confirmed: Obama spied on Trump.  They quoted Politico:  Trump transition members were under surveillance during Obama administration.  And they quoted Nunes:  Members of the Donald Trump transition team, possibly including Trump himself, were under surveillance during the Obama administration following November s election. Here s the full letter:Whoa. as flagged by the DCCC, Republicans are now fundraising on the false claim that Obama spied on Trump pic.twitter.com/AKzw3jAAQJ  Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) March 23, 2017Is there context? Of course not. That s nonexistent in their letter, but here s some: The quote from the Politico story is the caption on top of the video they posted of Nunes  press conference. And here s some more relevant context from that story: Nunes set off the firestorm with a news conference earlier in the day in which he described the surveillance of Trump aides through what s called  incidental collection,  something he noted was routine and legal. Such collection can occur when a person inside the United State communicates with a foreign target of U.S. surveillance. In such cases, the identities of U.S. citizens are supposed to be shielded   but can be  unmasked  by intelligence officials under certain circumstances. Furthermore, Nunes himself said: This is a normal, incidental collection, based on what I could collect. It alarms him anyway, for some reason.However, more significant than that is the fact that Nunes also said yesterday that he still has no evidence Trump, his team, or his campaign were wiretapped or otherwise the target of surveillance by the Obama administration. None. Zero, zip, zilch, nada.  I have said this for many, many weeks,  he told White House reporters.What we have now is a party that s actively and knowingly spreading Trump s lies to gain an edge they know they re losing. Should investigations conclude that not only did a sitting president level a demonstrably false accusation against his predecessor, but also that he colluded with Russia during the election cycle, the GOP is sunk.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"March 23, 2017"
 Photo Of GOP Meeting To Kill Maternity Care Goes Viral After People Notice Totally Offensive Detail,"In a stunning example of just how out-of-touch and heartless the Republican Party is towards women s healthcare, Vice President Mike Pence convened a meeting to discuss the topic of stripping maternity care requirements from health insurance   and forgot to invite even a single woman.Needless to say, an image of the meeting is now blowing up on social media as Americans sit in stunned amazement that this is how Congress and the White House think of the women who make up half the country.Democratic politicians were equally outraged. Massachusetts Representative Jim McGovern tweeted his anger over the sheer audacity of this meeting.

The bill has been nothing short of a disaster for Republicans. For starters, it keeps many of the items that infuriate conservatives intact, while at the same time doing everything that Obamacare did, but less well. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that over 24 million people would likely lose their health insurance thanks to this bill. For many people, it would also cause their premiums to skyrocket.Rather than fix the bill   or better yet, keep the ACA   Trump and Ryan are making huge concessions to the ultra-right. One such concession is to remove the  health care  part of the health care bill. Republicans are considering dropping the so-called  essential health benefits  of the ACA, allowing insurers to pick and chose what they want to cover. Naturally, things like maternity care and emergency services would be the first to go. Which brings us back to the  House Freedom Caucus  and its all-male members.In a dimly lit room, the group of conservative white men sat around a table and weighed the relative merits of providing maternity care to women. To give one an idea of how dismissive these elderly GOPers were towards giving health care to women, here s how Trump s Press Secretary Sean Spicer framed it:Sean Spicer on healthcare: ""I think if you're an older man you can generally say that you're not going to need maternity care.""

 Trump Supporter Full Of Regret Because Her Undocumented Immigrant Husband Is About To Be Deported,"A woman in Indiana is feeling the pain of Donald Trump s immigration policies personally. Apparently, she believed her family would be exempt because she voted for him.In 1998, Roberto Beristain crossed the southern border of the United States without documents to seek a better life. He found one.He opened a restaurant called Eddie s Steak Shed, fell in love with a woman named Helen, married her, and had four children.Immigration and Customs ignored Roberto and decided not to follow an order to deport him for over a decade. After all, he proved himself to be a model citizen and a productive member of society. Plus, he routinely checked in with ICE.His hypocrite wife, on the other hand, only has herself to blame for what Roberto is going through now.Because of Trump s obsessive anti-immigration crusade, Roberto has now been arrested and is going to be deported on Friday after being in the United States for nearly 20 years.As it turns out, Helen is a Trump supporter. She voted for him because she ironically believes that undocumented immigrants should be deported. However, she seriously bought Trump s claim that he would only deport criminals. The problem is that Trump and his rabid conservative base believe being an undocumented immigrant is a criminal act (it isn t). [Trump] did say the good people would not be deported, the good people would be checked,  Helen whined to Indiana Public Media.Of course, Trump lied. Surprise!Did Helen think that because she supported Trump that his policies for everyone else would not touch her own family? After all, Roberto is an undocumented immigrant and she was warned repeatedly during the 2016 campaign that Trump s immigration policies would even target immigrants who had not committed crimes.It s really hard to sympathize with Helen at this point. She willingly voted for a man who has an open disdain for immigrants and her vote is now coming back to haunt her.One wonders if she will continue supporting Trump after this or will she be yet another of the growing number of Trump supporters who turned their backs on him after they discovered they had been duped?Trump s immigration policies are literally tearing families apart and creating an atmosphere of fear and hate across the nation.This story just further demonstrates that you get what you vote for.Featured image via Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Images",News,"March 23, 2017"
 WATCH: Nancy Pelosi Takes House Intel Chair To The Woodshed For Being A Trump ‘Stooge’,"GOP Rep. Devin Nunes is feeling the burn after Nancy Pelosi ripped him a new one on Thursday.On Wednesday, Nunes went to the White House to personally give information to Donald Trump about the House Intelligence Committee s investigation into his Russia scandal.Nunes claimed that some Trump team members were incidentally caught on surveillance conducted by foreign intelligence and then suggested to the media that Trump s accusation against President Obama was right all along. I guess it all depends on one s definition of spying,  Nunes said during the rushed press conference, which was put together in a desperate effort to defend Trump.Nunes  press conference and his visit to the White House were done without the knowledge of the rest of the committee. Clearly, Nunes went rogue and disgraced himself in the process since he is the chairman of the committee.Furthermore, Nunes  actions make it clear that he s not interested in conducting a fair investigation. He s only interested in helping Trump.And that s why Nancy Pelosi nailed him to the wall. Chairman Nunes is deeply compromised, and he cannot possibly lead an honest investigation,  Pelosi told reporters.  He committed a stunt at the White House yesterday raising questions about Chairman Nunes  impartiality. Pelosi reminded the press that Nunes worked on Trump s transition team so it definitely looks like Nunes is doing Trump s bidding.She then blasted Republicans for desperately saying anything to help Trump. The Republicans are grasping at straws,  Pelosi said.  FBI Director Comey confirmed that President Obama did not wiretap President Trump, affirmed an investigation into links and coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Indeed, Comey dropped these bombshells last week during under oath testimony to Congress. The revelations nuked whatever shred of credibility Trump had left and now charges of treason are hanging over Trump and his administration.But Pelosi wasn t done with Nunes yet. She had even stronger words for him. By being a stooge of the president of the United States, he has demonstrated very clearly that there is no way there can be an impartial investigation under his leadership on that committee,  Pelosi declared. She then went on to call for the creation of an independent commission to continue the investigation.Here s the video via Twitter..@NancyPelosi calls House Intelligence Cmte Chair Devin Nunes a  stooge for the president of the United States  pic.twitter.com/RlqfPA5fNE  CSPAN (@cspan) March 23, 2017It s clear that House Republicans are colluding with Donald Trump to help him discredit the investigation against him. There needs to be an independent commission and a special prosecutor involved. Republicans have zero credibility to do their jobs. Nunes went behind his colleague s backs to deliver information to Trump and then held a hasty press conference. He s a shill for Trump, and this video of Nunes refusing to say whether he got his information from Trump proves it.Republicans are rigging the House Intelligence Committee investigation and something needs to be done about it.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 23, 2017"
 President Obama Came Out Of Retirement Today To Slam Republicans On Healthcare,"After two months of an administration that gives literal meaning to the term  bully pulpit,  it becomes easy to forget what a real president sounds like how a real president discusses disagreements. On Thursday, though, we received a brief reminder as President Obama took a break from his retirement to talk about health care and not once did he use the words  fake news  or even  sad. Today is the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act, a law, that despite Republicans  claims otherwise, took months and months to draft, debate and eventually pass. Obama, as well as anyone, knows that the law isn t perfect, but he does recognize some very basic facts, which boil down to we re much better with it than without it. Obama said it better in a statement on Thursday. So the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act,  Obama said.He s right. The uninsured rate has been cut almost in half since the law s inception and it goes down every year.Republicans want to change that and Obama didn t let that go. In his very diplomatic style that we so desperately miss, the President urged Republicans to pass a bill that would improve upon the Affordable Care Act, not make it worse. So if Republicans are serious about lowering costs while expanding coverage to those who need it, and if they re prepared to work with Democrats and objective evaluators in finding solutions that accomplish those goals   that s something we all should welcome,  he said.  But we should start from the baseline that any changes will make our health care system better, not worse for hardworking Americans. That should always be our priority.  Only, as we know, Republicans don t give a crap about making the law better, unless by better, you mean giving rich people a huge tax cut while leaving older poor people much, much poorer.Fortunately, the fate of this bill, which will go up for a vote on the anniversary of Obama s signature healthcare law, is uncertain to say the least. At this point, it s far more likely to fail than to pass.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images",News,"March 23, 2017"

He appeared to be very close, following a black guy,  a source said.  He slows down and at one point he turned around and came back. It s clear he was really focused on the guy for some time. Then, he falls out of camera view and doesn t attack the guy. He made statements that he was following the guy but something spooked him.

 Trump’s TIME Interview Is The Most Batsh*t F*cking Insane Thing You’ll Ever See,"Donald Trump at this point is known for spewing crazy statements, but in an interview with TIME, The Donald somehow managed to outdo himself in attempting to defend some of his more batsh*t insane lies.Asked about his claim that President Obama put a  tapp  on his  wires  at Trump Tower, The Donald explained that he has  articles saying it happened.  The random, word salady string of words Trump threw together to support this one is so impressively moronic that Sarah Palin seems like a genius by comparison: No, I have, look. I have articles saying it happened. But you have to take a look at what they, they just went out at a news conference. Devin Nunes had a news conference. I mean I don t know, I was unable to see it, because I am at meetings, but they just had a news conference talking about surveillance. Now again, it is in quotes. That means surveillance and various other things. And the New York Times had a front-page story, which they actually reduced, they took it, they took it the word wiretapping out of the title, but its first story in the front page of the paper was wiretapping. And a lot of information has just been learned, and a lot of information may be learned over the next coming period of time. We will see what happens. Look. I predicted a lot of things that took a little of bit of time. Here, headline, for the front page of the New York Times,  Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides.  That s a headline. Now they then dropped that headline, I never saw this until this morning. They then dropped that headline, and they used another headline without the word wiretap, but they did mean wiretap. Wiretapped data used in inquiry. Then changed after that, they probably didn t like it. And they changed the title. They took the wiretap word out. Devin Nunes did indeed have a  news conference  in which he did attempt to push Trump s lies by pointing out that many of The Donald s associates had been caught up in perfectly legal  incidental collection  while the FBI and other agencies were looking into foreign suspects. Nunes, a prominent member of Trump s transition team, also completely skipped telling his fellow Russia investigators of this development and ran directly to Mr. 45 with the information.Though Nunes has previously said there is no evidence that Obama  tapped  Trump s  wires,  The Donald took the incidental collection of information   a term he admits he does not understand   as proof that he was correct about that dastardly President Obama: Well, he just got this information. This was new information. That was just got. Members, of, let s see, were under surveillance during the Obama Administration following November s election. Wow. This just came out. So, ah, just came out. Trump also told TIME that he will be  proved right  about his wacky claim that three million undocumented immigrants voted for his opponent, swinging the popular vote in Hillary Clinton s favor. Despite the completely false nature of Trump s allegations, he says he s  forming a committee on it  and it may be  more than  three million   a  serious problem. Asked about his completely unfounded claim that thousands of Muslims celebrated in the streets of New Jersey after 9/11, Trump claimed that it was in the Washington Post. This claim has been disputed by literally everyone with any sense.Trump even defended his blatantly incorrect claim that Ted Cruz s father helped kill JFK by saying it was in a  newspaper.  It wasn t, but that didn t stop him from lying again: Well that was in a newspaper. No, no, I like Ted Cruz, he s a friend of mine. But that was in the newspaper. I wasn t, I didn t say that. I was referring to a newspaper. A Ted Cruz article referred to a newspaper story with, had a picture of Ted Cruz, his father, and Lee Harvey Oswald, having breakfast. In fact, according to The Donald, he is not responsible for any of his lies because someone else made the numerous false claims elsewhere and he simply repeated them: Why do you say that I have to apologize? I m just quoting the newspaper, just like I quoted the judge the other day, Judge Napolitano, I quoted Judge Napolitano, just like I quoted Bret Baier, I mean Bret Baier mentioned the word wiretap. Now he can now deny it, or whatever he is doing, you know. But I watched Bret Baier, and he used that term. I have a lot of respect for Judge Napolitano, and he said that three sources have told him things that would make me right. I don t know where he has gone with it since then. But I m quoting highly respected people from highly respected television networks. This is perhaps the most insane interview conducted with the President of the United States.

 WATCH: Oklahoma Republican Declares That Rape Is The ‘Will Of God’,"Women should get as far away from Oklahoma as soon as possible because Christian Sharia law is about to make their lives a living hell.If Oklahoma state GOP Rep. George Faught has his way, rape will be on the path to being legal in the state. At least that s what rapists are hoping for after Faught made a frightening statement on the subject during a debate on House Bill 1549, which restricts abortion.Democratic Rep. Cory Williams masterfully cornered Faught during the hearing by asking him if he believes rape and incest are the  will of God  since the legislation has no exceptions for either, meaning women would be forced to give birth to their rapist s baby.Faught s reply is absolutely appalling and demonstrates once again why women should never vote for Republicans, especially Republicans who want to base our laws on the Bible. Well, you know, if you read the Bible, there s actually a couple circumstances where that happened,  Faught said.  The Lord uses all circumstances. I mean, you can go down that path, but it s a reality unfortunately. Faught literally just used the Bible to justify rape. And then he used it to justify incest. Same answer,  Faught replied. Then he argued that Williams  questions have nothing to do with the bill. Williams vehemently disagreed and explained why. You are proffering a divine intervention as the reason why you won t do that and so I think it is very important,  Williams said before demanding Faught repeat his answer again.  This body wants to know   and myself personally   whether you believe rape and incest are actually the will of God. Faught obliged and stated that rape and incest are God s will because God is sovereign over all activities that happen. It s a great question to ask. And, obviously if it happens in someone s life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened, but   so you re saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someone s life and can t use anything and everything in someone s life and I disagree with that. Seriously.Here s the video via YouTube.This is exactly the same kind of statement that Republicans like Rick Santorum and Richard Mourdock made during the 2012 Election. I believe and I think the right approach is to accept this horribly created   in the sense of rape   but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you,  Santorum said during his run for the presidency.  As you know, we have to, in lots of different aspects of our life. We have horrible things happen. I can t think of anything more horrible. But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation. I ve struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize that life is that gift from God,  Mourdock said during his Senate run in Indiana. And even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen. Both of these assholes think that rape is sanctioned by God and that women should appreciate the  gift  God is giving them by force. It s disgusting and is the reason why both men lost their races.And now Faught should be ousted from office as well.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"March 22, 2017"

Beth Fukumoto attended the Women s March in protest of Donald Trump. As an American, Fukumoto has every right to exercise her freedom of speech and right to protest.But Republicans in the state decided that a woman s place is not in the Republican Party if she won t submit to Trump.So they stripped Fukumoto of her leadership position in the statehouse and tried to force her to resign simply because she criticized Trump.Republicans also condemned Fukumoto because she dared to work with Democrats on legislation to benefit the people of Hawaii.Fukumoto refused to be bullied by her sexist and racist colleagues and continued to represent her constituents. And now, after a couple months of thought, Fukumoto has decided to ditch the GOP to become a Democrat. When I joined the Republican Party eight years ago, I did so with a group of people my age who were full of hope, ideas and energy,  Fukumoto said.  I discovered that it wasn t just me and my Republican friends trying to change the status quo. There were good Democrats trying to change things too. So we started working together. But, in doing so, I ran into Republican partisanship that insisted I stop working with Democrats even when it clearly benefited our community. In a video explaining her decision, Fukumoto said that some constituents think she should stick it out in the GOP and be a voice of opposition from within. However, she would rather join the Democrats and actually get things done. I want to be productive,  she said.  I could stay. I could continue to criticize. I could be that voice of opposition, but what good does that do for the people of Hawaii, and what good does that do for my district? I think there s a much better opportunity that if I disagree with what the Republican Party is doing, to be able to work productively as a Democrat to offer a different solution, so that s what I m announcing today. Here s the video via KHON2.Indeed, what s the point of staying in a party that hates you? Ultimately, Fukumoto made the best decision by joining a party that actually appreciates her voice and ideas. Meanwhile, Republicans only have themselves to blame because they are so blinded by their loyalty to Trump that they literally let a woman who wanted to be part of the party s future become part of the Democratic Party instead.Once again, Republicans clearly demonstrated that women, especially women who criticize Trump, are not welcome in their party.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"March 22, 2017"
